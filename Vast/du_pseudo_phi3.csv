"Statement: Says the Annies List political group supports third-trimester abortions on demand.
Speaker: dwayne-bohac (republican party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: That's a premise that he fails to back up. Annie's List makes no bones about being comfortable with candidates who oppose further restrictions on late-term abortions. Then again, this year its backing two House candidates who voted for more limits.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off that started to begin in (President George W.) Bushs administration.
Speaker: scott-surovell (democrat party)
Topic: energy,history,job-accomplishments

Analysis: Surovell said the decline of coal ""started when natural gas took off  That started to begin in President (George W. ) Bushs administration. ""No doubt, natural gas has been gaining ground on coal in generating electricity. The trend started in the 1990s but clearly gained speed during the Bush administration when the production of natural gas -- a competitor of coal -- picked up. But analysts give little credit or blame to Bush for that trend. They note that other factors, such as technological innovation, entrepreneurship and policies of previous administrations, had more to do with laying the groundwork for the natural gas boom.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: Hillary Clinton agrees with John McCain ""by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran.""
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: Obama said he would have voted against the amendment if he had been present. So though Clinton may have ""agreed"" with McCain on the issue, they did not technically vote the same way on it. To say that voting for Kyl-Lieberman is ""giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran"" remains a contentious issue. But Obama's main point is that Clinton and McCain were on the same side, and that is correct.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: Health care reform legislation is likely to mandate free sex change surgeries.
Speaker: blog-posting (none party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: The release may have a point that Mikulskis comment could open the door to ""medically necessary"" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to gender and sexual orientation in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less).",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: The economic turnaround started at the end of my term.
Speaker: charlie-crist (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: Crist said that the economic ""turnaround started at the end of my term. ""During Crists last year in office, Floridas economy experienced notable gains in personal income and industrial production, and more marginal improvements in the unemployment rate and in payroll employment. But GDP didnt grow again until Scott took office. Economists say Crist deserves some credit for the economic turnaround because he accepted federal stimulus dollars, but they add that any state is inevitably buffeted by national and international trends far beyond their control.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.
Speaker: robin-vos (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: But Vos specifically used the word ""fired,"" which means faculty dismissed for just cause. Our rating Vos said the Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of UW faculty members who have been fired in the past 20 years. Six faculty members have been fired in the past two decades, while there have been nine different starting quarterbacks for the Bears in the past decade.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: Jim Dunnam has not lived in the district he represents for years now.
Speaker: republican-party-texas (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos. A broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasnt lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: I'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing, along with Russ Feingold, some of the toughest ethics reform since Watergate.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: ethics

Analysis: However, it was not that bill, but another one, sponsored by Majority Leader Harry Reid and introduced five days earlier on Jan.  4, 2007 that eventually became law. Obama was not a cosponsor, but he did successfully offer an amendment concerning lobbyist disclosure and the bill included some elements from the one he had introduced the previous year. Obama, as well as Biden, Clinton and Dodd all voted for it. In the House, Kucinich also voted for it.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific.
Speaker: oregon-lottery (organization party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: But Johnson is correct that many other factors played a role and for the Lottery to suggest that its money was the final piece is incomplete. The statement is partially accurate -- Lottery money made the lease competitive -- but it leaves out important details. Astoria dropped out; Newports bid was better on technical fronts than the others; legislative leaders pulled together to set aside the dollars and bonding authority.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
"Statement: Says GOP primary opponents Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a compromise vote that cost $788 million in higher electricity costs.
Speaker: duey-stroebel (republican party)
Topic: energy,message-machine-2014,voting-record

Analysis: Considering that the $532 million figure covers just 5 years, its reasonable to assume the 15-year total is higher. Our rating Stroebels ad says Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a ""compromise vote that cost $788 million"" in higher electricity costs. They cast that vote, and higher costs have followed.",1,You are an expert fact-checker and news analyst wi
