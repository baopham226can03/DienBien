"Statement: Says the Annies List political group supports third-trimester abortions on demand.
Speaker: dwayne-bohac (republican party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: That's a premise that he fails to back up. Annie's List makes no bones about being comfortable with candidates who oppose further restrictions on late-term abortions. Then again, this year its backing two House candidates who voted for more limits."
"Statement: When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off that started to begin in (President George W.) Bushs administration.
Speaker: scott-surovell (democrat party)
Topic: energy,history,job-accomplishments

Analysis: Surovell said the decline of coal ""started when natural gas took off  That started to begin in President (George W. ) Bushs administration. ""No doubt, natural gas has been gaining ground on coal in generating electricity. The trend started in the 1990s but clearly gained speed during the Bush administration when the production of natural gas -- a competitor of coal -- picked up. But analysts give little credit or blame to Bush for that trend. They note that other factors, such as technological innovation, entrepreneurship and policies of previous administrations, had more to do with laying the groundwork for the natural gas boom."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton agrees with John McCain ""by voting to give George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran.""
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: Obama said he would have voted against the amendment if he had been present. So though Clinton may have ""agreed"" with McCain on the issue, they did not technically vote the same way on it. To say that voting for Kyl-Lieberman is ""giving George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran"" remains a contentious issue. But Obama's main point is that Clinton and McCain were on the same side, and that is correct."
"Statement: Health care reform legislation is likely to mandate free sex change surgeries.
Speaker: blog-posting (none party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: The release may have a point that Mikulskis comment could open the door to ""medically necessary"" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to gender and sexual orientation in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less)."
"Statement: The economic turnaround started at the end of my term.
Speaker: charlie-crist (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: Crist said that the economic ""turnaround started at the end of my term. ""During Crists last year in office, Floridas economy experienced notable gains in personal income and industrial production, and more marginal improvements in the unemployment rate and in payroll employment. But GDP didnt grow again until Scott took office. Economists say Crist deserves some credit for the economic turnaround because he accepted federal stimulus dollars, but they add that any state is inevitably buffeted by national and international trends far beyond their control."
"Statement: The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades.
Speaker: robin-vos (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: But Vos specifically used the word ""fired,"" which means faculty dismissed for just cause. Our rating Vos said the Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of UW faculty members who have been fired in the past 20 years. Six faculty members have been fired in the past two decades, while there have been nine different starting quarterbacks for the Bears in the past decade."
"Statement: Jim Dunnam has not lived in the district he represents for years now.
Speaker: republican-party-texas (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: But determining that would take significant detective work, far more than a few photos. A broader interpretation would allow for the possibility Dunnam hasnt lived exclusively in his House district for years, but instead flits between -- and lives in -- both houses."
"Statement: I'm the only person on this stage who has worked actively just last year passing, along with Russ Feingold, some of the toughest ethics reform since Watergate.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: ethics

Analysis: However, it was not that bill, but another one, sponsored by Majority Leader Harry Reid and introduced five days earlier on Jan.  4, 2007 that eventually became law. Obama was not a cosponsor, but he did successfully offer an amendment concerning lobbyist disclosure and the bill included some elements from the one he had introduced the previous year. Obama, as well as Biden, Clinton and Dodd all voted for it. In the House, Kucinich also voted for it."
"Statement: However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific.
Speaker: oregon-lottery (organization party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: But Johnson is correct that many other factors played a role and for the Lottery to suggest that its money was the final piece is incomplete. The statement is partially accurate -- Lottery money made the lease competitive -- but it leaves out important details. Astoria dropped out; Newports bid was better on technical fronts than the others; legislative leaders pulled together to set aside the dollars and bonding authority."
"Statement: Says GOP primary opponents Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a compromise vote that cost $788 million in higher electricity costs.
Speaker: duey-stroebel (republican party)
Topic: energy,message-machine-2014,voting-record

Analysis: Considering that the $532 million figure covers just 5 years, its reasonable to assume the 15-year total is higher. Our rating Stroebels ad says Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a ""compromise vote that cost $788 million"" in higher electricity costs. They cast that vote, and higher costs have followed."
"Statement: For the first time in history, the share of the national popular vote margin is smaller than the Latino vote margin.
Speaker: robert-menendez (democrat party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: The senators correct that Latino voters put Obama over the top in winning the popular vote, according to both a Latino Decisions poll and exit polling data. The 2000 election was the first time when Latino voters delivered more than enough votes for a popular vote victory, but this years election marks the first time when Latinos were decisive in electing the overall winner, according to the founders of Latino Decisions."
"Statement: Since 2000, nearly 12 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: economy,jobs,new-hampshire-2012,poverty

Analysis: So where does this leave us?On Sanders side, he used a solid number, and hes clearly right about the underlying trend -- despite some ups and downs, there are more impoverished Americans today than there were in 2000, both measured by raw numbers and as a percentage of the population. But we think he goes too far when he suggests these 12 million Americans simply fell from the middle class into poverty. And he ignores the fact that as those 12 million Americans were slipping into poverty, many, many Americans were simultaneously climbing out of poverty."
"Statement: When Mitt Romney was governor of Massachusetts, we didnt just slow the rate of growth of our government, we actually cut it.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: history,state-budget

Analysis: nan"
"Statement: The economy bled $24 billion due to the government shutdown.
Speaker: doonesbury (none party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,health-care

Analysis: Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the government shutdown cost the economy $24 billion. That is based on the highest of the independent estimates. Three prominent forecasters, Goldman Sachs, IHS and Moodys assessed the damage at $20 billion. A survey of economists set $16 billion as the most likely figure. There is broad agreement that the political impasse produced uncertainty that puts an ongoing, if unquantified, damper on growth. Trudeau likes to say he aims for verisimilitude and he achieved that with his use of a high but defensible estimate from an independent source."
"Statement: Most of the (Affordable Care Act) has already in some sense been waived or otherwise suspended.
Speaker: george-will (columnist party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: With all the talk about problems with the health care law, its easy to forget just how many corners of health insurance policy the law affects. Will seemed guilty of that on Fox News Sunday when he said most of the law has been waived or suspended. Obama has made at least two major course corrections in the law. He delayed the employer mandate by one year and allowed individuals dealing with canceled plans to buy insurance that fails to meet minimum standards under the law. One way to put these changes into context is to look at the number of people they affect. While precise data are missing, the combined impact could be in the range of 1 million Americans. On the other side of the ledger, 3. 1 million young adults have gained access to coverage through the law, another 18 million people are subject to the individual mandate and millions more have benefited from requirements that health insurance companies spend premiums on care."
"Statement: In this last election in November, ... 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, ... 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Sanders said that ""in this last election in November, . . . 63 percent of the American people chose not to vote, . . . 80 percent of young people, (and) 75 percent of low-income workers chose not to vote. ""Sanders was too loose with some of his numbers and his wording, but he has a point that rates of non-voting among Americans, and especially among younger and poorer Americans, are high."
"Statement: McCain opposed a requirement that the government buy American-made motorcycles. And he said all buy-American provisions were quote 'disgraceful.' 
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: I firmly object to all 'buy America' restrictions, as they represent gross examples of protectionist trade policy. ""He added, ""Furthermore, as a fiscal conservative, I want to ensure our government gets the best deal for taxpayers and with a 'buy American' restriction that cannot be guaranteed. ""The McCain campaign did not respond to Obama's charge. But his past words say it all."
"Statement: U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out
Speaker: national-republican-congressional-committee (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: And the debt is a result of tax cuts as well as various spending measures, and both Democrats and Republicans supported such measures."
"Statement: Water rates in Manila, Philippines, were raised up to 845 percent when a subsidiary of the World Bank became a partial owner.
Speaker: gwen-moore (democrat party)
Topic: financial-regulation,foreign-policy,water

Analysis: Moore said that when the International Finance Corporation became a part-owner of Manila Water, rates rose 845 percent. The source cited by Moores staff undermines that number. The International Finance Corporation bought its stake in 2004. Between 2004 and 2012, rates rose about 170 percent. Moore incorrectly used a figure that would apply to the period from 1997 to 2012. However, the IFC crafted the plan for privatization in the first place. All parties knew that important capital investments would follow, and that rates would go up. Moore wrongly pegged the rate increase to the date of IFCs equity position, but the development corporation played a key role from the start."
"Statement: Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year.
Speaker: jack-lew (democrat party)
Topic: bankruptcy,economy,population

Analysis: Our ruling  Lew said that ""almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year. ""That appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While thats not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States."
"Statement: Women and men both are making less when you adjust for inflation than when John Kitzhaber was first elected governor.
Speaker: dennis-richardson (republican party)
Topic: economy,income

Analysis: It didnt, in other words, change the final result. The Richardson campaign did get back to us but, regardless, the information it provided doesn't hold up. Data from the two federal agencies and the state Employment Department show that both genders make more today, when their wages are adjusted for inflation, than they did when Kitzhaber was first elected in 1995."
"Statement: The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free world.
Speaker: eric-bolling (none party)
Topic: corporations,taxes

Analysis: Bolling said the United States has ""the highest corporate tax rate in the free world. ""He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, hes right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States corporate tax rate doesnt appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition."
"Statement: We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: Clinton said, ""We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history."
"Statement: Says Scott Walker favors cutting up to 350,000 families and children off health care.
Speaker: greater-wisconsin-political-fund (none party)
Topic: health-care,message-machine

Analysis: Walker changed course to a muddier position, while Greater Wisconsin has continued to cite the number. It adds an important qualifier though -- ""up to"" 350,000. Walkers new position, while unclear, still focuses on reining in BadgerCare enrollment -- whether its the 68,000 or some other number remains to be seen."
"Statement: Says Mitt Romney wants to get rid of Planned Parenthood.
Speaker: planned-parenthood-action-fund (none party)
Topic: abortion,federal-budget,health-care

Analysis: The Planned Parenthood Action Fund aid said that Romney wants to ""get rid of Planned Parenthood. ""That directly contradicts what Romney has said -- that he wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, not abolish the organization -- and his staff reaffirmed that position. Theres no question that an end to federal funding would be a significant blow to the organizations operations, potentially chopping 12 percent to 35 percent from its budget. But its an exaggeration to say that Romney would act to ""get rid"" of the organization. UPDATE: After our story appeared, Planned Parenthood provided some additional statistics about how many Medicaid patients use their services."
"Statement: I dont know who (Jonathan Gruber) is.
Speaker: nancy-pelosi (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Pelosi said, ""I don't know who (Jonathan Gruber) is."
"Statement: Hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: crime,diversity,homeland-security,terrorism

Analysis: Clinton said that ""hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino. ""Calculations by the director of an academic center found that the number did triple after those attacks. But its worth noting that his data does not show whether or not they remained at that elevated level, or for how long -- something that would be a reasonable interpretation of what Clinton said."
"Statement: Rick Perry has never lost an election and remains the only person to have won the Texas governorship three times in landslide elections.
Speaker: ted-nugent (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: And, Jillson said, he would not term Perrys 06 win a landslide. Indeed, he said, the governors 39 percent amounted to a comeuppance; 60 percent of voters chose a different aspirant. Our take: Perry is the third--not first--Texas governor to win re-election thrice. Two of his wins were bona fide landslides but the thirds landslide status is at least debatable."
"Statement: ISIS supporter tweeted at 10:34 a.m. Shooting began at 10:45 a.m. in Chattanooga, Tenn.
Speaker: pamela-geller (activist party)
Topic: technology,terrorism

Analysis: Geller updated the original post, but it did little to stuff the rumor back into the bag."
"Statement: Youth unemployment in minority communities is about 40 to 45 percent.
Speaker: peter-kinder (republican party)
Topic: diversity,economy,jobs

Analysis: Defining which cities, suburbs and townships are ""minority communities"" is a matter of debate. But its worth noting that Fergusons youth are not only more unemployed than their peers in St.  Louis , they are also significantly more unemployed on average than both white and black 16-24 year-olds across the country. Ferguson was the community in question when Kinder cited the rate of 40 percent to 45 percent of youth unemployment in minority communities  and Ferguson does fit into Kinders estimate."
"Statement: Says Paul Ryan is still endorsing Trump.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,elections,campaign-advertising

Analysis: The New York Times and ABC News said Ryan responded to criticism for not supporting Trump more by emphasizing that he wasn't withdrawing his endorsement. Our rating Clinton says Ryan ""is still endorsing Trump."
"Statement: If you look at states that are right to work, they constantly do not have budget deficits and they have very good business climates.
Speaker: nicholas-kettle (republican party)
Topic: economy,labor,states,unions,workers

Analysis: They did generally rank right-to-work states higher than union states, but they considered many other factors, including tax policy, that could account for the better rankings. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."
"Statement: What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is youre not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants.
Speaker: shelley-moore-capito (republican party)
Topic: climate-change,energy,environment,government-regulation

Analysis: Capito said ""What (Obama is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants. ""The proposal Capito is referring to is an EPA plan to cut carbon emissions in existing power plants. Those rules do not prohibit current facilities from burning coal, and even Capitos spokeswoman said the rule ""doesn't mean that every plant has to close. ""Some facilities will close down within the next decade, but many of those plants were scheduled to be retired anyway due to age and other factors. States and power companies have options to continue to utilize coal for energy, and experts said they expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come."
"Statement: We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses dont pay a business tax.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: small-business,taxes

Analysis: Scott said ""70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax. ""His general point was that during his tenure, hes been cutting all sorts of taxes. State data for 2011 taxes shows that 76. 8 percent of businesses dont pay the corporate income tax due to the exemption. Scott is including some very small businesses here in his calculation and omitting that many of them were exempt from paying this tax before he took office."
"Statement: Says Mark Pryor votes with Obama 93 percent of the time.
Speaker: tom-cotton (republican party)
Topic: bipartisanship,voting-record

Analysis: Cotton said Pryor ""votes with Obama 93 percent of the time. ""Since Obama became president, Pryor has voted in line with the presidents positions between 90 and 95 percent of the time, with 92. 6 percent -- basically 93 percent -- as the average, according to the best rating system at our disposal. Pryor doesnt vote with the Democratic Party quite as often, though, and in 2013 his presidential support votes were lower than every other Senate Democrat. Cottons number is on target based on the data, but Pryor has also opposed Obama on a few key issues."
"Statement: We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats.
Speaker: ted-cruz (republican party)
Topic: consumer-safety,corrections-and-updates,government-regulation,market-regulation,states,supreme-court,workers

Analysis: Cruz, railing against modern interpretations of the Commerce Clause and the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, said, ""We have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats."
"Statement: Austin is a city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded.
Speaker: lee-leffingwell (democrat party)
Topic: city-government,population

Analysis: Leffingwell said Austin is a ""city that has basically doubled in size every 25 years or so since it was founded."
"Statement: The nuclear test conducted in our nation this time is the Earth's 2,054th nuclear test. The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have conducted 99.99 percent of the total nuclear tests.
Speaker: north-korea (none party)
Topic: military

Analysis: That means 99. 37 percent of all the tests were done by the five permanent members of the U. N.  Security Council, he said. ""It's about right,"" Sublette said of the figures cited by North Korea. ""If it's off, it's only off by a few (tests). ""We aren't inclined to quibble with fractions of one percent."
"Statement: In the case of a catastrophic event, the Atlanta-area offices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will self-destruct.
Speaker: walking-dead (none party)
Topic: health-care,pop-culture

Analysis: We are pleased to reassure the CDC's neighbors that they do not need to install flame-proof siding. The CDC said none of its emergency plans involve blowing up its campus. Plus, the AJC reported two cases in which the CDC emergency generator failures did not coincide with subnuclear explosions."
"Statement: Under President George W. Bush, we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama weve added $6.5 trillion to the debt.
Speaker: kelly-ayotte (republican party)
Topic: debt

Analysis: Ayotte said that the country has added $6. 5 trillion to the national debt since Obama took office and $4. 9 trillion under Bush. When measuring by total debt, shes correct on both counts."
"Statement: Says a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: legal-issues,supreme-court

Analysis: Rubio mentioned a female Supreme Court Judge and then concluded, ""if you are an appellate lawyer you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward. ""Rubio was implying that Justice Ginsburg favored South African law rather than the U. S.  Constitution, and that some cases in the U. S.  might be decided based on South African law. Rubio could have poked fun atGinsburgscomments without distorting them. There is nothing in Ginsburgsinterview in which she suggested that any legal matter in the U. S.  should be decided based on anything from South African law. Ginsburg was giving advice to another country on how to draft a constitution, and she suggested examples written more recently than the U. S.  Constitution. She didnt dis the U. S.  Constitution -- she explained that it was written at a time when slavery was legal and women didnt have equal rights. In fact, Ginsburgalso heaped lots of praise on the U. S.  Constitution."
"Statement: Says Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.
Speaker: keep-promise-1-pac (republican party)
Topic: military,voting-record

Analysis: A pro-Cruz PAC said that Marco Rubio ""skipped 18 defense votes, including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS. The ad also omits that Rubio voted for the overall bill, which passed the Senate. The majority of the skipped votes were amendments, while many others were procedural or related to votes after the bill passed the Senate. The ad also omits that Cruz voted against the bill."
"Statement: Rep. David Cicilline is responsible for the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra, the failed solar company
Speaker: national-republican-congressional-committee (republican party)
Topic: energy,stimulus

Analysis: The full name of the legislation under which the stimulus package was approved gives this one away -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Cicilline took office in January 2011, a full 23 months after passage of the bill enacting the loan guarantee program that benefited Solyndra. The National Republican Congressional Committee has every right to call the stimulus a ""boondoggle. ""And its fair to say that Cicilline supported the stimulus before taking office. But Lindsay said that Cicilline is ""responsible for this irresponsible investment. ""Wed say that Lindsay and the National Republican Congressional Committee simply used overheated rhetoric, but thats an understatement. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."
"Statement: Says Ohio budget item later signed into law by Gov. John Kasich requires women seeking an abortion to undergo a mandatory vaginal probe.
Speaker: rachel-maddow (none party)
Topic: abortion,pundits,women

Analysis: And with Kasich up for re-election next year, its no surprise that Democrats are eager for a debate that draws contrasts with the governor. But there should be no debate about what types of ultrasounds these new regulations require. Had Maddow read the language closely, she would have seen a mandate -- for external detection methods."
"Statement: We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term 'terrorist attack' but instead substitutes 'man-made disaster.' 
Speaker: jerry-patterson (republican party)
Topic: homeland-security,terrorism

Analysis: Just two weeks ago, American hotels were the target of bombings in Jakarta that killed eight people and injured six Americans. More recently, Napolitano told CNN on May 2, 2010  the day after a sport-utility vehicle holding a bomb was found in New Yorks Times Square  that the incident was being treated as if it could be a potential terrorist attack. And on Friday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said: The secretary speaks publicly about terrorism often, including in a speech less than 90 minutes ago to the American Constitution Society. Patterson said Friday that Napolitanos continued use of man-made disaster proves his point. The essence of his charge at the convention was that the secretary cant and wont say terrorist attack. News accounts, congressional testimony and speeches prove otherwise."
"Statement: African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: diversity,economy,jobs

Analysis: During the debate, Sanders said that ""African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent. ""He has a point that African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But his numbers are too far off. Using the standard method for determining the jobless rate, the figure for African-American youths is 31. 5 percent and for Hispanic youths its 18. 6 percent. While those rates are still disproportionately high, they are not nearly as high as Sanders said."
"Statement: Obamacare will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: health-care,immigration

Analysis: The chain email says that Obamacare provides insurance ""to all non-U. S.  residents, even if they are here illegally. ""Its actually citing a 2009 proposal that didnt pass, but that doesnt really matter. The Affordable Care Act does nothing to provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. (A non-U. S.  resident could be living in Mexico, France or even Mars)."
"Statement: President Barack Obama took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commissions ideas. Not one.
Speaker: john-boehner (republican party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget

Analysis: If Boehner had offered a more measured assessment, he would have had a fair point about the differences between Obamas fiscal approach and that outlined by the commission. The president certainly could have gone further in embracing the recommendations of the panel he had commissioned. But he did embrace a wide variety of them, so to say bluntly, as Boehner did, that Obama ""took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commissions ideas"" is simply not correct. To one degree or another, the commissions recommendations are sprinkled throughout Obamas budget proposals, in recognizable -- if not always in identical -- form."
"Statement: It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Humayun Khans) life.

Topic: iraq,military

Analysis: Pierson said, ""It was under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton that changed the rules of engagement that probably cost (Capt. Under the rules of engagement in 2004 and today, Khan would have been able to use deadly force to defend himself. More importantly, Khan died five years before Obama became president and Clinton his secretary of state. (Update: This fact-check has been updated to include Pierson's comments on CNN from Aug."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton in 2005 co-sponsored legislation that would jail flag burners.
Speaker: blog-posting (none party)
Topic: patriotism

Analysis: The online site Townhall. com said Hillary Clinton co-sponsored legislation in 2005 that would jail flag burners. Clinton did indeed co-sponsor a bill that would have done just that. Republicans have backed similar legislation in the past, even though the courts have ruled flag burning is legally protected."
"Statement: Says the paperback edition of Mitt Romneys book deleted line that Massachusetts individual mandate should be the model for the country
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: health-care,states

Analysis: Perry's right that Romney's comments about health care were edited between editions. Among other things, a line that advocated the Massachusetts model as a strong option for other states was replaced by a shorter, more generic sentence. But that line was preceded by an argument for state-level solutions, exactly the argument Romney extends now. That's not how Perry characterized it. So he did win that bet  by not betting."
"Statement: Maggie Hassan raised tuition, making it the highest in America.
Speaker: national-republican-senatorial-committee (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: The National Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan ""raised tuition, making it the highest in America. ""For starters, in-state tuition in New Hampshire for four-year colleges has been the highest in America for years, but it was that way before Hassan took office. As for Hassans role as governor, of the two budgets she crafted, one gave the university system enough money to freeze tuition, according to USNH leaders, and the other one didnt. Additionally, the state budget does not dictate tuition rates, the board of trustees does. In addition, the Republican-controlled Legislature pared down what Hassan offered in her budget proposal."
"Statement: Says Terry McAuliffe is the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom.
Speaker: ken-cuccinelli (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance,ethics,history

Analysis: Cuccinelli, in attacking McAuliffes ethics, says the Democrat is ""the person who invented the scheme to rent out the Lincoln Bedroom. ""McAuliffe authored a memo in early 1995 listing ways Clinton could connect with top Democratic patrons. But the original note did not mention White House sleepovers; that idea was later added in the handwriting of others. McAuliffe has always denied he came up with the scheme; Clinton in 1997 took full responsibility for the idea. No doubt, McAuliffe strongly backed the sleepovers and recommended heavy hitters that should be offered a night in the Lincoln Bedroom."
"Statement: We created 800,000 new jobs, we cut the unemployment rate almost in half and today New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history
Speaker: andrew-cuomo (democrat party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: During a press briefing in Ontario County, Gov. Cuomo told a group of reporters that 800,000 jobs had been created, the unemployment rate fell by almost half, and the state had more private sector jobs than ever before."
"Statement: We have towns in West Texas that are out of water, that are having to truck in water.
Speaker: sid-miller (republican party)

Analysis: Miller said: ""We have towns in West Texas that are out of water. ""In recent years, towns around Texas occasionally ran dry until new wells or water plants met needs. But Miller named no towns out of water of late nor did we identify any."
"Statement: In Georgia, women earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by men.
Speaker: jim-barksdale (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,women

Analysis: Democratic U. S.  Senate candidate Jim Barksdale that women in Georgia only earn 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man. But the statement is missing substantial context needed to fully grasp a very complex issue. When asked for clarification, Barksdale's campaign issued a statement that veered into the equal-pay-for-equal-work argument, something the study behind the statement did not attempt to address."
"Statement: A federal system that verifies employees are authorized to work in the U.S. is inaccurate anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80 percent of the time.
Speaker: david-raynor (none party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: But his suggestion the error rate ranges between 50 and 80 percent was too high. E-Verifys worst error rate -- for illegal workers -- is high, but its still well below what Raynor suggested. For all workers, it shrinks to 2. 3 to 5. 7 percent."
"Statement: They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in 06. And they couldnt get environmental impact statements.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Trump said, ""They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements. ""The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of an additional 700 miles of fencing along the U. S. -Mexico border. While there were environmental concerns related to the construction, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived required environmental reviews in order to proceed with construction. Trumps statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements."
"Statement: Sen. Obama's campaign announced that he's choosing his cabinet.
Speaker: john-mccain (republican party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Has Obama ""announced that he's choosing his Cabinet""?What's happening is the usual transition planning that occurs with any presidential campaign in the final days before an election."
"Statement: In 2008, only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out.
Speaker: battleground-texas (democrat party)
Topic: elections,population

Analysis: The Battleground Texas advocate said that in 2008, ""only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out. ""Research rooted in federal surveys and an analysis starting from the state's 2008 voting roll supports those figures, while our own estimates starting from Texas studies suggest a larger share of voting-age Latino citizens registered and a smaller share of them voted--which, if so, could still be fodder for pushes to improve participation."
"Statement: Only 2 percent of public high schools in the country offer PE classes.
Speaker: michelle-obama (democrat party)
Topic: education,health-care

Analysis: Official federal data show that more than 95 percent of high schools in 2006 required PE -- a far cry from the 2 percent Obama cited."
"Statement: Said he's the only Republican candidate ""who's actually turned around a government economy.""
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)
Topic: job-accomplishments

Analysis: Whether Huckabee's ""investment"" of higher taxes for better services was a good move is not is not a turnaround category Giuliani lists. It has to be kept in mind that the economic circumstances each chief executive faced were very different. Giuliani can't match Romney in the corporate turnaround business. And Giuliani's view of what constitutes a turnaround doesn't consider everything, but Giuliani clearly has clear accomplishments when it comes to a government turnaround."
"Statement: On military recruiters at Harvard, Elena Kagan ""took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong.""
Speaker: john-barrasso (republican party)
Topic: education,gays-and-lesbians,kagan-nomination,military,supreme-court

Analysis: Justice Samuel Alito did not  participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral  arguments were made. ""The court did  reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR  and the brief filed by the Harvard professors. All of the justices who  voted opposed the law schools' arguments."
"Statement: There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. And there are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools.
Speaker: empower-texans (none party)
Topic: education,message-machine,taxes

Analysis: More recent data available from the agency shows both have increased; still, the ratio of teachers to non-teachers is about the same. But Sullivan's online call to action doesn't do justice to the state's actual mix of school workers. The majority of non-teachers aren't administrators or paper shufflers; they're people who work directly with students including counselors, librarians, therapists and bus drivers."
"Statement: Under Mayor Cicilline, [Providence] was a sanctuary city.
Speaker: john-depetro (talk-show-host party)
Topic: history,homeland-security,immigration,legal-issues,pundits

Analysis: John DePetro said that under Mayor David Cicilline, Providence ""was a sanctuary city. ""While there is no legal definition of ""sanctuary city,"" in the eight years that Cicilline was mayor Providence had not taken any of the measures adopted by other cities often identified by that label.

"Statement: At Bain Capital, we helped start an early childhood learning company called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)

Analysis: Romney said the first lady ""praised"" Bright Horizons. She did say that she was ""excited"" to launch an initiative that included the child care provider, calling Lets Move partners ""so important. ""Those are favorable comments about the company."
"Statement: Says the man who rushed the stage at him in Dayton, Ohio, had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS in his social media posts.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: civil-rights,elections,terrorism

Analysis: Trump said Thomas DiMassimo, the man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, ""had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS"" in his social media posts. There is lots to offend people on DiMassimos social media posts. But there doesnt appear to be any legitimate connection between DiMassimo and ISIS. The link Trump tweeted was a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. Its also unlikely that someone who really had ISIS ties and who had been arrested for threatening a presidential candidate on live television would be quickly released from custody pending trial. The police report of his arrest makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. UPDATE, March 14, 2016: In an interview with CNN on March 13, DiMassimo ""vehemently denied belonging to ISIS. He told CNN the video was doctored and provided a link to what he said was the original footage from a protest he participated in more than a year ago.

"Statement: U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey gave the government the power to electronically spy on Americans without a warrant.
Speaker: michael-opitz (republican party)
Topic: criminal-justice,terrorism

Analysis: But he does raise a legitimate criticism of CISPA. The bills protections may not be enough to keep average Americans safe from Hall and Oates private eyes. Opitzs statement raises real issues. But he overstates some key points, and it could use a lot more context."
"Statement: Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: economy,financial-regulation,message-machine

Analysis: Let's take this one step at a time. First, she was one of four statewide elected officials to agree to change the process for selling state bonds that ultimately resulted in paying $770,321 in commission fees to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Second, she had no idea when she approved the new bond sale process -- called a negotiated sale -- that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive $770,321. That came months later as part of the negotiations between the bond underwriters and the Division of Bond Finance. Three quarters of a million dollars . . . The money in question is just about right. The total commission paid to Bank of America and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit was $770,321. Our colleagues at Factcheck. org, for instance, said that the contract at issue was not a no-bid contract. The state held an RFP for companies to be bond underwriters in general, not to specifically bid on bond sales. Thirty-nine companies responded, and ultimately 12 were chosen. There was no competitive bidding for the $300 million lottery revenue bond issue. The state negotiated a deal among those 12 companies. That's a no-bid contract to us, because the setup specifically prevents open competition that could produce lower interest rates. But the question here iswhether there were bids for this specific bond issue. To Bank of America . . . The fees actually were paid to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired. But what's critical to note, again, is that while Bank of America interests represented two of the 12 members of the state bond underwriting team, Sink had no idea when she approved the slate of underwriters what specific role each bank would play in any specific bond sale. And even when she approved the $300 million lottery bond issue, it wasn't yet clear whether the sale of those bonds would be by a competitive or negotiated process. The resolution she and three others approved included either option. The bond issue was using lottery revenues, not general tax revenues. That means you buying lottery tickets paid for the bond sale and the bank commissions. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit. ""That statement is accurate, as it properly notes that the negotiated bond sale process resulted in $770,000 in fees for Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, without trying to tie the money directly to Sink. Scott isn't nearly as careful in his TV ad. Sink didn't funnel $770,000 to Bank of America. First, she was one of four votes on the Cabinet to approve the particular type of bond issue in question -- along with Republicans Charlie Bronson and Bill McCollum and then-Republican Charlie Crist. Second, she had no way of knowing how much commission Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive for the bond sale when she approved the deal. Those details came months later during negotiations between state bond administrators and the banks."
"Statement: If you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since (Bob McDonnell) became governor.
Speaker: terry-mcauliffe (democrat party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: Economists say governors have little control over economic conditions. Virginia has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation this century. Those points aside, McDonnell bills himself as a job-creating governor. McAuliffe accurately summarized one set of statistics about employment in Virginia during McDonnells term."
"Statement: Under Obama, home values in Florida collapsed, construction jobs were lost and the state had a high foreclosure rate.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: housing,message-machine-2012

Analysis: But each one of those trends began well before Obama was elected. Analysts say they have been driven by a natural and inevitable market correction much more than by any government policies. But since the ad draws a cause/effect relationship -- the cause being Obamas presidency, the effect being a sour housing market -- its worth noting that more of the decline in home values happened on Bushs watch, and in the last year Florida housing has again begun to appreciate. Homeowners in Florida who have watched their property value sink and their neighbors houses abandoned in foreclosure know this didnt start when Obama walked into the White House. Theyre in at least year seven of this grim reality."
"Statement: The new Arizona immigration law ""says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person.""
Speaker: alfredo-gutierrez (democrat party)
Topic: immigration,legal-issues

Analysis: Stephen W.  Yale-Loehr, an adjunct law professor at Cornell University, agreed that this is a recipe for confusion. That said, we think that a close reading of the law and the views of the    experts we contacted do allow us to draw some conclusions. Gutierrez' statement -- that the law ""says that any police officer can stop anyone who appears to them to be reasonably suspicious of being an undocumented person"" -- is fairly accurate, but not entirely. While the law does appear to provide significant latitude for law enforcement officers in Arizona to question people about their immigration status -- on a pretext as basic as a broken taillight -- the law also says the grounds cannot be based on race or ethnicity alone."
"Statement: The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II.
Speaker: david-cote (none party)
Topic: debt

Analysis: In hard dollars, its not even close. The current $16. 49 trillion debt is far larger than at any other point in U. S.  history. But, the debt-to-GDP ratio tells a different story. The current ratio, 73 percent, is among the nations highest. But, as Cote notes, it still has a ways to go to get to the 106 and 109 percent levels reached during and after World War II. However, Cote was unspecific about comparing todays debt to the exact end of World War II in August, 1945, or the era following the war. As noted, the debt remained higher for six years after the war than it is today."
"Statement: The cost of health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down the federal budget deficit.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget,health-care

Analysis: Obama saidthe cost of ""health care is now the single-biggest factor driving down"" the federal budget deficit. The CBO recently lowered its projection for long-term deficits and specifically cited health care costs as the main reason, though the Affordable Care Act is not necessarily the primary cause of that calculation. That said, even though projections are lower than they were years ago, health care spending is rising in the short term and will keep adding to the deficit."
"Statement: During the recession, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent.
Speaker: george-will (columnist party)
Topic: economy,abc-news-week

Analysis: On the surface, then, the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift. The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth, at least in the short run. ""We'll acknowledge that there's a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rate's growth during the recession. But on Will's core factual assertion -- that the savings rate has climbed during the recession -- he's correct."
"Statement: On whether a U.S. Supreme Court nominee should be forthcoming at confirmation hearings.
Speaker: elena-kagan (democrat party)
Topic: kagan-nomination,supreme-court

Analysis: ""I think it is an important question, and a difficult question, about how an election contest that at least, arguably, the political branches can't find a way to resolve themselves, what should happen, and whether and when the court should get involved. It's hard to think of a more important question in a democratic system, and maybe a tougher one. ""In ruling on this statement, we find that Kagan herself has walked back her previous position on how much Supreme Court nominees can and should comment during nomination hearings. She indicated she would not be answering questions that she had previously said were not only permissible but desirable."
"Statement: Says one out of three U.S. homeless men is a veteran.
Speaker: texas-veterans-commission (none party)
Topic: poverty,veterans

Analysis: Using U. S.  Census Bureau statistics to extrapolate the percentage of males among veterans (93 percent), McGhee comes up with a figure of 99,720 homeless male veterans  slightly more than one-third of the total number of adult homeless people calculated from the January 2009 one-night survey."
"Statement: Says Charlie Crist supports cuts to the Medicare Advantage program.
Speaker: republican-party-florida (republican party)
Topic: health-care,medicare

Analysis: The Republican Party of Florida said Crist supports ""cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. ""Crist has flip-flopped on a lot of issues, including the federal health care law. He used to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but now he supports it. The law tries to bring down future health care costs by reducing Medicare Advantage payments. But on the issue of Medicare Advantage, Crist has actually been consistent: He's been critical of the Medicare Advantage cuts for years. He specifically said he opposed the reductions in 2009 and 2010, and he still opposes them today. Crist doesnt appear to have come up with other ways to save money on health care without reducing payments to Medicare Advantage."
"Statement: I think it is unacceptable for the Chinese today to be larger in wind power and in solar panels and photovoltaic manufacturing than all of Europe put together -- forget the United States.
Speaker: maurice-ferre (democrat party)
Topic: energy

Analysis: China added more renewable-power capacity than any other country in the world in 2009, according to the Worldwatch Institute. But Ferre's point was manufacturing when he met with the Sun-Sentinel editorial board. His statement that China is larger than Europe and the United States in the manufacturing of wind and solar power equipment is correct for photovoltaics, but not for wind."
"Statement: Says Scott Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control.
Speaker: jeanne-shaheen (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,legal-issues,women

Analysis: Shaheen said Brown ""co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control. ""The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for birth control -- an issue about which there has been a longstanding policy debate on religious and moral grounds."
"Statement: At some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control.
Speaker: susan-happ (democrat party)
Topic: sexuality

Analysis: So, that also serves to skew the numbers behind the point she is making. Our rating Happ said ""at some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control. ""Its clear she was arguing that contraception use is widespread, and important for women who run the risk of getting pregnant."
"Statement: In the past 20 years, Egypt has made great strides in political and democratic reform.
Speaker: sameh-shoukry (none party)
Topic: foreign-policy,abc-news-week

Analysis: There is no meaningful political space here. ""In our ruling, we find little to support the ambassador's statement that ""Egypt has been on a road of economic, political, democratic reform for the last 20 years or more, and it has achieved great strides in that regard. ""A few things may have improved, particularly in the area of press freedom, but they are hardly ""great strides. ""In fact, the government continues to arrest journalists, police brutality is widespread, and the ruling party maintains firm control."
"Statement: The amount of attention paid this week to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi ... pale in significance.
Speaker: karl-rove (republican party)
Topic: terrorism,transportation

Analysis: Rove said that the coverage of Christie pales ""in significance"" to the coverage of Benghazi. When news of the attacks on Benghazi broke, coverage was widespread, and it continued through congressional hearings. Moreover, a lot of the coverage questioned the administrations narrative and response to the attacks. Indeed, Christie has occupied much of the conversation, but it was also in a relatively slow news week. Benghazi garnered significant coverage, even during the height of the presidential election. Perhaps the outcome of those reports didnt unearth the conspiracy conservatives alleged and hoped for. More is still likely to come out, and Republicans continue to keep it in the news. But to insinuate the mainstream media ignored the attacks while putting Christie through the ringer goes too far."
"Statement: Says U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going.
Speaker: gwen-graham (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Graham said Southerland ""voted to keep the shutdown going. ""The ad refers to an Oct.  16, 2013, no vote Southerlandcast against a bipartisan Senate bill that funded the government and ended the shutdown. By the time it reached the House floor, it was clear to lawmakers that their vote would effectively be deciding whether to end the shutdown or not. If more Republicans had joined Southerland in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Regardless of Southerlands personal feelings about a shutdown, Graham is focusing her attack on his vote -- and his vote was a clear ""no"" to ending the shutdown."
"Statement: In Rick Perrys Texas, we import nurses ... from other countries.
Speaker: bill-white (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: The center said that to meet the demand for registered nurses by 2020, the number of graduates will need to triple from the 2009 level, when 8,211 people graduated. Texas nursing schools are still turning away qualified applicants -- about 8,700 in 2009, primarily because the schools lack sufficient faculty, the center reports. Upshot: White is correct that Texas imports nurses from abroad. But implying that Perry is to blame for that disregards the governor's efforts to address a shortage that existed before he became governor, and has persisted despite efforts by the state to produce more Texas-trained nurses."
"Statement: There is a federal criminal law that says its a crime to transport dentures across state lines.
Speaker: bob-goodlatte (republican party)
Topic: public-health

Analysis: He made the statement while promoting a bill that would repeal what he considers to be unnecessary laws. The congressman didnt mention that."
"Statement: We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders.

Analysis: Booker said, ""We built a new prison every 10 days between 1990 and 2005 to keep up with our mass incarceration explosion of nonviolent offenders. ""Booker is right that a new prison was built every 10 days during that period. But while there was a significant rise in the incarceration rate of nonviolent offenders, it took place over a longer time period than the post indicates -- between 1980 and 2013."
"Statement: Sen. McCain's tax plan provides ""virtually nothing to the middle class.""
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)

Analysis: Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers AMT exposure."
"Statement: Austin is burdened by the fastest-growing tax increases of any major city in the nation.
Speaker: jim-skaggs (none party)
Topic: city-budget,city-government,taxes

Analysis: Skaggs said Austin has the fastest-growing tax increases of any major U. S.  city. Among the nations largest cities, Austin appears to have had the third-fastest growth in its property-tax bite on a median-valued home from 2005 to 2013. It seems reasonable to speculate local taxpayers feel the pinch. However, Skaggs didnt provide nor did we find a sign of Austin ranking first in tax growth among the countrys major cities."
"Statement: Phoenix, Arizona, is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world.
Speaker: john-mccain (republican party)

Analysis: In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital. We found nothing confirming Phoenix as No."

"Statement: Says a poll found him the only Republican candidate who could beat Barack Obama in Texas -- and by eight points.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: polls

Analysis: In the June poll, all told, Romney performed better in Texas than other Republicans against Obama, but contrary to his statement, he was not the only Republican to best him. He was the only candidate who did so by more than the poll's margin of error. But Romney is hardly the only Republican who could win the state. No Democratic presidential nominee has carried Texas since 1976."
"Statement: President Ronald Reagan sent troops into conflict only in one circumstance, which was in Grenada We were in a peacekeeping setting in Lebanon.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,history,military

Analysis: Romney said the U. S.  stayed out of conflict settings under Reagan, except once in Grenada. Romney put Lebanon in a separate category of ""a peacekeeping setting. ""The record shows multiple military engagements and a large loss of life in Lebanon. Reagan was wary of the actual use of troops, but he did not stick to that as much as Romney suggests. Romney may have been thinking of long-term deployments, but he spoke only of whether American soldiers were placed into conflict settings which did take place."
"Statement: Says David Jolly supports privatizing Social Security.
Speaker: florida-democratic-party (democrat party)
Topic: social-security

Analysis: Democrats say Jolly ""supports privatizing Social Security,"" using a paraphrased statement that private accounts should be on the table in discussing future reforms. They also point to the fact Jolly had a meeting with Ryan to discuss the program. Jolly says hes been very clear where he stands on Social Security, but we dont think its all that apparent. Saying private accounts should be an option doesnt denote advocacy, but rather a willingness to explore options. Which option Jolly favors isnt so clear, beyond setting some kind of benefit guarantee for people who have already qualified for Social Security or are currently receiving payments. He hasnt said whether private accounts were at the top of his list of potential fixes, only that they should be considered. Democrats are attempting to make it sound like he is 100 percent behind the idea, but dont offer any proof beyond a paraphrased statement."

"Statement: The average student in Florida, what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities for tuition is as much or less than what they spend on cellphones.
Speaker: will-weatherford (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Weatherford defended his call for a tuition hike before the leaders of the state university system by saying students spend more on cellphones than ""what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities"" for tuition. We found his point is accurate if you compare the average out-of-pocket cost for all schools against the average cellphone bill, but there are caveats. Remember, hes just talking about tuition, not the many other costs involved with a students degree. For the cash-paying families that comprise a majority of the system, the comparison is a little off, with students paying more for tuition than the average cellphone. Others spend a lot less on tuition, or a lot more, depending on their university. More than one-third of Floridas public university students receive enough merit- and need-based financial aid that they do not pay anything for tuition and fees."

Analysis: The National Association of Realtors wrote that millions of Americans could face a hefty tax bill if Congress does not extend this act. Its possible, if the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act isnt extended. The Realtors estimate that it could have an impact on one-quarter of transactions seems on target, if you add up the percentage of homes in foreclosure and short sales.

"Statement: The Florida Department of Agricultures website FreshFromFlorida.com can be used to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house.

Analysis: Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that at the Florida Department of Agricultures website FreshFromFlorida. com, people can ""get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house. ""But fingerprints are required as part of the application process, and Gross made no such distinction in his statement. We think his overall message was clear: He was trying to convey that its so easy to get a gun permit that you can do it from home. The law, though, requires that people receive firearms training and be fingerprinted by law enforcement, two elements that would typically require people to leave their homes."
"Statement: The Atlanta streetcar is expected to create 930 jobs during construction, totaling more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years.
Speaker: federal-transit-administration (none party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: In fact, it will take an estimated 467 jobs to construct the line, plus 23 jobs that last 20 years or longer to run the streetcar. Experts think the remaining 4,600 jobs will be for those who produce materials needed to build the line or products workers purchase with their earnings, as well as employees of new businesses the streetcar brings to surrounding neighborhoods. This means that when the Federal Transit Administration announced the streetcar project would ""create an estimated 930 jobs during construction,"" totaling more than 5,600 over the next 20 years, it gave a misleadingly high impression of the actual positions needed to construct and run it. If public officials keep exaggerating the number of jobs created by this project, PoiltiFact Georgia will keep turning up the heat."

Analysis: Grimes said that raising the minimum wage to $10. 10 an hour would lift ""over a million Americans out of poverty. ""The report she sites actually puts the net figure slightly less than a million, at about 900,000. Grimes campaign later said she misspoke but our job is to check what the candidates tell the voters at the time. The stat Grimes actually said is close but not quite on the ball."

Speaker: mitch-mcconnell (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,history,terrorism

Analysis: McConnell said Secretary of State John Kerry, ""when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. ""We arent comparing Kerrys Nicaraguan visit to the recent Republican senators letter to Irans leadership."
"Statement: NATO is opening up a major terror division. ... Im sure Im not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,military,terrorism

Analysis: Trump said, ""NATO is opening up a major terror division. I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it, but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. ""The change hes apparently referring to -- the creation of a new senior post and division for coordinating intelligence sharing -- is just the most recent incremental change in how the alliance handles counter-terrorism, a topic it has addressed, in big ways and small, for more than 30 years. Experts said such changes typically require a longer gestation period so that all member nations can get on board."
"Statement: Sen. Obama has always had a 100 percent prochoice rating.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)

Analysis: The Planned Parenthood Action Fund similarly gave Obama a perfect score on its 2006 congressional scorecard. He also earned 100 percent records for his votes in eight years as a state senator, according to Pam Sutherland, president and CEO of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council. (She is neutral in the presidential race and her group has not endorsed a candidate. )""He has always voted in favor of abortion rights,"" she said."

Analysis: Frank Caprio said that since Gina Raimondo took office, investment fees on the state's pension portfolio ""have gone up from about $12 million annually to about $50 million. ""State records show that, at first blush, the numbers were $13. 1 million in 2010 and $46. 0 million now. He's not on the money, but close. But it's not clear if Caprio has given a complete accounting of his expenses for fiscal 2010."
"Statement: The (federal) debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: deficit,economy,federal-budget

Analysis: Upshot: We think it's reasonable to pause where Perry's research team landed in March. At that time, the CBO estimated the government would record $1. 5 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2010, which breaks down to about $4. 1 billion per day, though (as we note) those figures have since ratcheted down a bit. We're persuaded too that a case could be made for paying closer attention to the shifting ratio of the debt to the GDP. Regardless, Perry's calculation was on target."
"Statement: Under President Barack Obamas jobs bill, states would no longer have to lay off teachers, firefighters and police officers.

"Statement: Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old.
Speaker: terry-mcauliffe (democrat party)
Topic: education,retirement

Analysis: Virginia does not keep data that is solely focused on the age of teachers. The best statistics available show that the states instructional staff -- including teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- was 98,792 during the 2010-11 school year and, of them, 33,462 were 50 or older. The teaching corps is not moving toward retirement with anything close to the speed that McAuliffe described."
"Statement: Two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions.

Topic: government-regulation,jobs,poverty,welfare

Analysis: Our rating    Walker said two-thirds of Wisconsinites receiving unemployment checks ""are not required to search for work due to current work search exemptions. ""The statement is accurate, but needs additional information -- namely that the vast majority of unemployment insurance recipients who arent required to look for work are expected to be working again relatively soon, many at the same jobs they were laid off from."
"Statement: Under President Obamas health-care reforms, the premium for an average plan for a family didnt go down by $2,500 per year, its gone up about $2,500 per year.
Speaker: ron-johnson (republican party)
Topic: corporations,economy,health-care,public-health,workers

Analysis: So, whether Obamacare has helped raise, or kept a lid, on premiums remains largely unknown. Our rating Johnson said that under Obamas health-care law, the premium for ""an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year. ""Johnson is correct that by 2013, three years after the Affordable Care Act became law, the total average premium for employer-provided family insurance had risen by $2,500 per year."
"Statement: The IRS also investigated liberal groups, groups that had progressive in their name. ... The IRS was basically looking at everybody.
Speaker: donna-brazile (democrat party)
Topic: elections,taxes

Analysis: Brazile said the IRS was ""looking at everybody"" including liberal groups and progressive groups. Yes, some progressive groups did have their tax-exempt status applications flagged as the IRS reviewed whether nonprofit groups were engaging in political activities. But it wasnt to the same degree as tea party and other conservative groups, nor did it result in the same actions. The list targeting tea party groups resulted in delayed processing that in some cases lasted almost three years and inquiries into their donors. Further, the inspector general found tea party groups were systematically singled out as part of an office-wide effort, while progressive groups were not."
"Statement: Says Obama promised unemployment would never go above 8 percent.

"Statement: President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York.
Speaker: adam-hasner (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,israel,message-machine-2012

Analysis: Hasner said, ""President Obama decided not to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. ""Obama was in New York on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday is the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, and Netanyahu will be in New York on Thursday and Friday. Obama is campaigning in Virginia on Thursday, and his schedule for Friday has not yet been released. So a meeting with Netanyahu didnt fit Obamas schedule. However, he is the president of the United States, and at the end of the day he determines his schedule. The White House has confirmed that a scheduling conflict prevented a meeting. That's not quite refusal, but he is not meeting with Netanyahu in New York, so on some level he made the decision."
"Statement: In a majority of states, you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love.
Speaker: mark-pocan (democrat party)
Topic: civil-rights,gays-and-lesbians,states

Analysis: That means 28 states -- a majority -- do not have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Our rating Pocan said,""in a majority of states you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love. ""Federal law does not explicitly protect against this discrimination, though the agency tasked with enforcing the law has interpreted federal protections to include sexual orientation. Meanwhile, 28 out of 50 states do not have such laws."

Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)

Analysis: He also has six years as U. S.  attorney in New York, where he prosecuted mob figures and Wall Street titans. By contrast, Biden's fellow Democrat John Edwards has only six years of experience in the Senate. Barack Obama has only three in the U. S.  Senate and eight in the Illinois Senate. We find Biden's rhetoric is not backed up by the facts because it ignores Giuliani's considerable experience as U. S.  attorney and mayor of the nation's largest city."
"Statement: About half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators.

Analysis: Cruz said about half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators. Governors have had a good run of late and, over all, comprise 42 percent of all presidents with 37 percent being former senators. Perhaps overlooked by Cruz; 14 presidents were neither. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

Topic: economy,retirement

Analysis: After Britains vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s,"" Clinton said. Experts told us that Clintons calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of 401(k) assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote. That being said, those losses are very likely impermanent. 401(k) accounts are long-term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this."
"Statement: Medicaid spending declined by 1.9 percent in 2012, the second such decline in 47 years.
Speaker: kathleen-sebelius (democrat party)

"Statement: Says 88 Texas constables have died in the line of duty.
Speaker: bruce-elfant (democrat party)

"Statement: Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000.
Speaker: republican-party-florida (republican party)

"Statement: The city of Columbus would save $41 million a year if employees had to contribute to their own, guaranteed-check pensions.

Analysis: Yost would have been more precise, and only slightly less compelling, had he simply noted that Columbus would have saved $41 million last year. That, in fact, is how The Dispatch referred to the savings. And readers also would have been fully informed had he acknowledged Colemans efforts to reduce pickups; Yosts implication was that without SB 5, the savings would not materialize otherwise. Those are needed points of clarification and additional information."

""She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Dont worry well get to the bottom of it.

Analysis: Scarborough said that about ""3 percent of murders and crimes are committed with guns from people who actually (legally) purchase those guns. ""Recent studies that look at prisoners who had a gun when they committed a crime found that between 3 and 11 percent purchased the weapon at a store or gun show.

"Statement: The years that I was speaker, the Florida House consistently offered leaner budgets than the governor offered.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: state-budget,taxes

Analysis: Rubio says the House budgets he proposed in 2007 and 2008 were ""leaner budgets than the governor offered. ""In 2007, the budgets offered by Rubio and Crist ultimately were pretty similar, with the difference being just about $500 million in a budget totaling more than $70 billion. The budgets in 2008 were significantly different, however, primarily because Crist wanted to use trust funds to help balance a bigger budget. Rubio advocated cutting state spending to make the budget smaller. It's also worth noting that state revenue projects took a turn for the worse in between when Crist proposed his budget in 2008, and when Rubio and the House proposed theirs."

""Keysers campaign pointed to Bennets votes against a permanent ban on transferring detainees to a U. S.  military prison and his opposition to blocking construction funding for a prison to hold Gitmo prisoners in the United States. While Bennet has long supported closing the Guantanamo Bay prison, his statements and legislative record show that, since 2009, Bennet has opposed attempts to relocate detainees from Guantanamo to a Colorado prison, including Colorados federal supermax prison.

Analysis: Hannity said, ""The president said hes going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country. ""Hannity says his number represents a three-year figure of the total number of refugees the United States is expected to admit worldwide. But thats all lost on the viewing audience, who gets no idea of the time frame and would reasonably think hes talking about only refugees from Syria and Iraq. From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2015 and is saying it will accept 85,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 and 100,000 in Fiscal Year 2017. Over those three years, thats about 6,000 refugees more than the recent annual average. Overall, Obama is asking the country to take in an additional 45,000 refugees in 2016 and 2017.

"Statement: Newt Gingrichs immigration plan offers a new doorway to amnesty.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: ""Amnesty"" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. Hes said that process should look at each individual and whether they have ""family, church and community ties. ""They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, the word amnesty means simply forgiving groups of people who have broken the law. Most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Words matter, and under a more straightforward definition, Gingrichs plan is clearly amnesty, though it may be limited in scope. Romney said that Gingrich's plan offers ""a new doorway to amnesty,"" which suggests that Gingrich's plan allows for legalization without being the same as the older amnesty law."
"Statement: Mr. Caprio is a career politician who has never worked in the private sector.
Speaker: john-robitaille (republican party)

Analysis: But to call someone ""a career politician"" suggests that's all he did. And the fact remains that Caprio had a legal career that spanned 15 years. Not only that, in working for himself as a private practice lawyer, he ran precisely the kind of small business that Robitaille says Caprio has no experience with. It's clear the Robitaille team issued this statement without doing even the smallest bit of research, so it's tempting to award him a Pants on Fire."

Topic: debt,federal-budget,taxes

Analysis: Brat says that under the current U. S.  path, ""In just 17 years, spending for Social Security, federal health care and interest on the federal debt will exceed all tax revenue. ""A CBO report concludes that, in a worst-case scenario in which Congress resumes its old habits of cutting taxes and raising spending, this could happen in 2031 -- 16 years from now. Under a somewhat rosier scenario, in which current budget policies are kept in effect, the U. S.  would hit bottom in 2044. Brats focus on the bleaker outlook isdefensible because Congress this century has not shown great fiscal discipline. Were dealing with scenarios, however, and Brats statement would have been more accurate if he acknowledged from the outset that the U. S.  ""could"" run out of tax money for many major programs instead of saying it ""will. ""No doubt, however, the U. S.  is on a risky fiscal path."
"Statement: President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: campaign-finance,economy,elections,financial-regulation,history,stimulus,voting-record

Analysis: Clinton said, ""President Obama took more money from Wall Street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had. ""Adjusting for inflation, Obama garnered about $3 million more than George W.  Bush if you look at the broad ""finance, insurance and real estate"" sector. But using the ""securities and investment"" category, a tighter measure of Wall Street contributions, Obama clearly set a new record in 2008. Yet that record only lasted four years. Romney upped that ante by $5 million in 2012."
"Statement: Donald Trump has said nuclear proliferation is OK.
Speaker: mark-warner (democrat party)
Topic: nuclear

Analysis: Warner said Trump has said ""nuclear proliferation is OK. "" Trump hasnt quite gone that far. Hes voiced his ""hate"" for nukes and said, ""I dont want more nuclear weapons. ""But Trump also repeatedly has said that the nuclear race is ""going to happen anyway,"" and that Japan and South Korea - both facing threats from North Korea - might be ""better off"" with nukes of their own. In discussing the issue, Trump has said the U. S.  ""cannot afford to be the military and the police for the world,"" and that allies dont pay enough for U. S.  protection. So Trump certainly has said hes open to proliferation by certain allies but isnt sold on it."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton has taken over $800,000 from lobbyists.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: ethics

Analysis: The $800,000 number is correct. A recent analysis by the center showed Clinton has accepted $865,290 from lobbyists, based on data released on March 20, 2008. The threshold of contributions by industry the ad lists for Clinton is probably too low, said Massie Ritsch, a spokesman for the center. The center's analysis found the following amounts that lobbyists gave to Clinton:    * Energy: $442,800    * Pharmaceuticals/health products: $450,450    * Hospitals, health services/HMOs and insurance companies: $552,050    * Health professionals: $114,755."
"Statement: Barack Obama has never even worked in business.
Speaker: rob-portman (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: (The job also overlapped with his time in the Illinois Legislature. )If you count the best-selling books that have brought Obama millions of dollars in royalties, he also knows something about entrepreneurship. Our rating    Clearly, Obama has had less experience in the private sector than Romney; before he became president, he spent most of his working life either in the non-profit sector or in politics. However, Portman went too far when he said that Obama has ""never even worked in business."
"Statement: Says the Arizona immigration law expressly bans racial profiling.
Speaker: john-cornyn (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: PolitiFact concluded that the revised law has too much wiggle room to back up Brewer's statement that it lays ""to rest questions over the possibility of racial profiling. ""He simply said the law expressly bans such profiling, and it does  though the law also expressly leaves room for profiling that passes constitutional muster, a significant and legally squishy factor that Cornyn's statement doesn't acknowledge. Experts expect the profiling topic to be thrashed out for years to come."
"Statement: Says Gov. Rick Perry has been begging for the federal government to send the Coast Guard to patrol two lakes on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Speaker: louie-gohmert (republican party)
Topic: crime,immigration

Analysis: Gonzalez said the Coast Guard already comes to the lake ""once in a while. . . not very often"" because, he speculated, of budgetary limits. Our sense: Its possible Perry has informally talked to some House members about putting the Coast Guard on the lakes--where that force already periodically ventures. But hes made no formal direct request to the government. Thats far from ""begging"" for Coast Guard deployment."
"Statement: On the VA: Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: health-care,veterans

Analysis: ""Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care,"" Trump said in a Norfolk speech in which he promised to overhaul the VA.  Trump offered the most dire possible interpretation of a scathing report on VA record-keeping and went well beyond what the inspector general was able to conclude. The report found that 307,173 dead people were listed last year on a VA database as having pending status with the agency. But shabby records make a detailed dissection of that number impossible. Investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began. No doubt, the VA is ripe for criticism."
"Statement: Were now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: debates,federal-budget,government-efficiency

Analysis: Depending on which data set you use, Romneys numbers are either correct or close. But they dont tell the whole story. A large share of the spending has come not from the cost of government employees, buildings and equipment but from transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with)."
"Statement: Rob Cornilles supports privatizing Medicare.
Speaker: democratic-congressional-campaign-committee (democrat party)
Topic: medicare,message-machine-2012

Analysis: But that doesnt mean he wants to privatize Medicare. And his encouraging private competition doesnt change the fact that Medicare currently has a private option. Those two factors are what we call critical facts that would give a different impression."
"Statement: In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas.
Speaker: texas-right-life (none party)
Topic: abortion,corrections-and-updates

Analysis: Texas Right to Life said, ""In 2005, Dan Branch tried to expand third-trimester abortions in Texas. ""TThis statement would hold up if Branch's amendment loosened established limits. To the contrary, lawmakers including Branch embraced specific restrictions superseding a broad limit stating that any fetus with a severe, irreversible abnormality could be aborted in the third trimester. If Branch's proposal had been adopted, such abortions could have taken place if a fetus had a severe irreversible impairment to the brain or--Branchs wrinkle--another vital organ.

CLARIFICATION, 4:50 p. m. , April 25, 2014: We added some details to the body of this article and revised the section on our ruling."
"Statement: We (Democrats) have made steady progress creating jobs and improving our schools.
Speaker: armond-budish (democrat party)
Topic: education,government-efficiency,job-accomplishments,jobs

Analysis: College tuition    The last state budget did freeze college tuition costs, a move engineered by the Strickland and the House Democrats. So lets check the tally. And with all but the last one, there were additional critical details you needed to know to have a full understanding of the context, especially Budishs assertion about tax credits."
"Statement: Michigan and Massachusetts raised their bottle deposit and could no longer afford the program because the redemptions were so high there was no profit in there.
Speaker: jeff-kruse (republican party)
Topic: environment

Analysis: Kruse tried to persuade his Senate colleagues that too-high deposits in Michigan and Massachusetts were crippling those programs. But Michigan says thats not the case and Massachusetts doesnt even have a higher deposit rate."
"Statement: Whether you like to admit it or not, half our general revenue goes to education.
Speaker: mike-haridopolos (republican party)
Topic: education,state-budget

Analysis: Ruling    As Haridopolos talked in Tallahassee about the grim state budget prospects for this coming year, he said state education funding might see cuts. Part of the problem is just how much of the budget is tied to education funding, he said -- half of the state's general revenue fund. To be honest, Florida's education funding structure is way more complicated than Haridopolos let on. But he's right that the state general revenue fund, which is a little more than a third of the overall state budget, is being used primarily to fund education."
"Statement: Im the only one whos fought against developers draining the Everglades!
Speaker: kendrick-meek (democrat party)
Topic: environment,message-machine

Analysis: I would characterize (Rubio) as going along, not as providing leadership. Similarly, Crist and Rubio have also taken stepstobackmeasures that support Everglades restoration."
"Statement: Says Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program.
Speaker: americans-united-change (none party)
Topic: crime,debt,federal-budget,social-security

Analysis: It would have allowed younger workers to contribute portions of payroll taxes into government-approved private mutual fund accounts. Our rating Americans United for Change says: ""Ron Johnson calls Social Security a Ponzi scheme and wants to privatize the program. ""Johnson calls Social Security a legal Ponzi scheme to emphasize that it uses taxes on todays wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans."
"Statement: There are 31 other states and 10,000 other cities that have the same type of policies that we just passed, referring to North Carolinas House Bill 2.
Speaker: paul-skip-stam (republican party)
Topic: gays-and-lesbians,government-regulation,sexuality

Analysis: Stam said there are dozens of states and thousands of cities that businesses should also avoid if they truly oppose North Carolinas new law. Thats overly broad, since the law does many different things. In some cases, North Carolina is one of two states or the only state with policies that HB2 brought into law. But Stam clarified that he was talking specifically about discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. Technically there are 29 other states, not 31. That doesnt really detract from the point he was trying to make  but the fact that he glossed over other parts of the bill does."
"Statement: Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: climate-change,terrorism

Analysis: Sanders said, ""Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism. There are, of course, many other factors that contribute to terrorism, including religious and ethnic tensions and political repression."
"Statement: The jobs bill includes President Obamas tax on soup kitchens
Speaker: eric-cantor (republican party)
Topic: economy,jobs,taxes,workers

Analysis: Cantor's blog post was headlined ""President Obama's tax on soup kitchens. First, Obama did not single out soup kitchens for special tax treatment. And second, the proposal is not a tax on soup kitchens, or any other charitable organizations; it effectively increases the existing tax burden on a small percentage of households, which may indirectly cause disincentives for donations to soup kitchens."
"Statement: Says the Obama administration spent taxpayer dollars on electric cars in Finland (and) windmills in China.
Speaker: paul-ryan (republican party)
Topic: stimulus

Analysis: Paul Ryan said stimulus dollars were spent on electric cars in Finland and windmills in China. In fact, the program that provided loan guarantees for the Fisker cars was not part of the stimulus -- and the money went toward engineering and design in the United States."
"Statement: While Sarah was Mayor of Wasilla she tried to fire our highly respected City Librarian because the Librarian refused to consider removing from the library some books that Sarah wanted removed.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: civil-rights

Analysis: But Palin did ask the librarian if she would consider removing books. Maybe it was posed as a rhetorical question as Palin says."

"Statement: We have more illegal immigrants here than we did five years ago.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Rubio said, ""We have more illegal immigrants here"" than we did five years ago. Multiple estimates show that the illegal immigrant population has stabilized, or even decreased, from its peak in 2007 through 2014, the latest available data. According to Pew, the illegal immigrant population was 11. 3 million in 2014, down from 11. 4 million five years prior in 2010. This is in sharp contrast to dramatic and steady increasesthroughout the 1990s and early 2000s."
"Statement: Says Rick Perry wrote a letter supporting Hillarycare.
Speaker: ron-paul (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the presidents health care task force at a time when the presidents general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans."
"Statement: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office received zero complaints about the Washington Redskins name.
Speaker: blog-posting (none party)
Topic: sports

Analysis: Conservative blog posts smell a scandal in the cancellation of the Washington Redskins trademark, pointing out that the U. S.  Patent and Trademark Office ""received zero complaints"" about it before an administrative law court ruled in June. In other words, they do exactly what the five plaintiffs in this case did here."
"Statement: The presidents health care proposals will cause most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people lose their current insurance coverage.
Speaker: nancy-pfotenhauer (republican party)
Topic: health-care,pundits

Analysis: Then she said -- and this was not phrased as an opinion -- that the plans will cause ""most Americans to have their premiums increased, not decreased, and hundreds of millions of people to lose their current insurance coverage. ""There's not an independent, nonpartisan analysis out there on the current Democratic proposals that shows that."
"Statement: (Mexican immigrants) are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.
Speaker: gary-johnson (libertarian party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Johnson said Mexican immigrants are not ""murderers and rapists"" but are actually ""more law-abiding than U. S.  citizens and that is a statistic. ""Numerous studies by scholars and partisan groups show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, and experts say this includes Mexican immigrants. Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime, but the information available does not disprove Johnsons point."
"Statement: Says Chris Christie vetoed a jobs package of 30 bills.
Speaker: stephen-sweeney (democrat party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: Its correct to say the governor vetoed numerous bills aimed at supporting businesses and job growth, and thus stopped them from becoming law."
"Statement: There are already more American jobs in the solar industry than in coal mining.
Speaker: sheldon-whitehouse (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change,energy,environment,jobs

Analysis: The one source that offered a contrary view, the National Mining Association, cited two-year-old numbers and counted categories such as off-site transportation workers on coal barges and ocean freighters. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri."
"Statement: Says Illinois gubernatorial candidate Bill Bradys first priority after winning the primary was to sponsor a bill that would mass-euthanize sheltered dogs and cats in gas chambers.
Speaker: pat-quinn (democrat party)
Topic: agriculture,job-accomplishments,message-machine

Analysis: So where does this leave us?Quinn's stark ad is right that the bill was sponsored two days after the primary but it incorrectly suggests that it was Brady's first act after winning. Quinn is close on the substance of what the bill would have done. But the ad oversteps somewhat in suggesting that the bill would have required mass euthanizations, rather than just allowing them, and it glosses over the fact that Brady dropped his sponsorship and that the bill has been moot for most of this year."
"Statement: Barack Obama is in an economy thats only worsened since hes been president of the United States.
Speaker: matthew-dowd (independent party)
Topic: bankruptcy,economy,history,housing,income,job-accomplishments,pundits,abc-news-week,workers

Analysis: And to take just one example, a recent Bloomberg poll found that 35 percent of respondents thought they were better off than they were two years ago, 51 percent thought they were worse off and 14 percent were unsure. Similarly, while the poll found almost even approval ratings for Obama generally -- 47 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove -- his rating on the economy was far worse, at only 41 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove. Foster, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact that the two most important factors to look at are GDP and jobs, and these two divide just as neatly as the other factors, with one pointing to an improved economy and the other pointing to an economy that has gotten worse."
"Statement: Romney failed to take action against ""sanctuary cities"" in Massachusetts.
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Late in his term, Romney approved a plan to deputize state troopers to help enforce immigration laws, although the plan was not implemented because it was rescinded by his successor, Gov. We expect to see this allegation repeated as the campaign goes on, though. The Giuliani campaign has apparently been searching for cities with policies of not turning in illegal immigrants; they recently upped their count of Massachusetts sanctuary cities from three to six."
"Statement: Says New Jersey is down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak and with Gov. Chris Christie New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment for 12 consecutive months.
Speaker: one-new-jersey (democrat party)
Topic: economy,job-accomplishments,jobs

Analysis: One New Jersey said the state is ""down nearly 200,000 jobs from its pre-recession peak"" and ""for 12 consecutive months, New Jersey has trailed the rest of America when it comes to unemployment. The numbers are mostly right, but they need clarification."
"Statement: Says Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States with an elevated temperature.
Speaker: darrell-issa (republican party)
Topic: ebola,health-care,public-health,transportation

Analysis: Issasaid Thomas Eric Duncan came into the United States ""with an elevated temperature. ""According to the CDC, Duncan did not have a fever when he left Monrovia. At the time, American airports were not screening travelers, so theres no way for us (or Issa) to know definitively if he had a fever when he got to the United States. But he did not report falling ill until several days after arriving, when he went to the hospital with a fever. Its possible that even if current screening measures had been in place, Duncan would have passed without showing a fever or other symptoms."
"Statement: We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nations history.
Speaker: robert-gibbs (democrat party)
Topic: afghanistan

Analysis: Gibbs said, ""We have been in Afghanistan longer now than we have been in any foreign land conducting a war in our nations history. ""People can make different interpretations as to what constitutes a war. We take no issue with Gibbs interpretation but acknowledge that people might see the Banana Wars as the longest U. S.  conflict on foreign soil. Gibbs is accurate, but his statement requires some additional context."
"Statement: Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office.
Speaker: michael-williams (republican party)
Topic: energy,gas-prices

Analysis: The relationship is a correlation, and other factors contribute to public perceptions of a president. ""Gas costs $2 more per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president saw such a price surge by this point of his presidency. However, Williams errs by implying the president is at fault; key factors driving gas prices are beyond a presidents control."
"Statement: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships.
Speaker: alan-grayson (democrat party)
Topic: marriage,message-machine,women

Analysis: In his new ad, ""The Facts,"" Grayson says ""Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. ""In 1990, Webster sponsored HB 1585, which would create a new form of marriage called covenant marriage. If women agreed to form a covenant marriage, they would not be allowed to divorce because of physical or sexual abuse. The only out under Webster's legislation was adultery."
"Statement: Says judges get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state.
Speaker: chris-christie (republican party)
Topic: pensions

Analysis: Christie, during a news conference on judicial pensions, said judges ""get better benefits at a lower cost than everybody else in the state. ""The average annual pension benefit for new retirees in the judicial pension system is the largest. And judges contributed, prior to the pension and benefit reform law, 3 percent of their salary toward their pension, the smallest percentage among public employees."
"Statement: There are a lot of casinos across the country that have gone bankrupt.
Speaker: robert-jacquard (democrat party)
Topic: bankruptcy,economy,gambling,state-budget,state-finances,states

Analysis: Gambling is a boom or bust industry. Even when times are good, casinos fail. And when times are bad, even more fail. As Schwartz told us, casinos ""definitely are not a sure thing. ""Good management matters -- a point Jacquard made as well. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."
"Statement: Small businesses create 70 percent of the jobs in America.
Speaker: eric-cantor (republican party)
Topic: economy,jobs,small-business

Analysis: One could reasonably expect small businesses to generate the most jobs in the private sector since, according to the SBA, small firms make up 98 percent of the businesses in the U. S. Overall, about half of the private sector jobs that exist in the U. S.  are provided by small businesses, according to the SBA. Though they provide a boost to job creation when times are good, the SBA noted in a 2010 report to President Barack Obama that the flip side is that small businesses can lead the way on job losses when the economy is sluggish. In 2009, when the economy was limping out of a recession, small businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the roughly 5. 7 million jobs lost, according to BLS figures."
"Statement: Seniors with coverage under Medicare Advantage will give up ""more than their share"" because of health care reform
Speaker: americas-health-insurance-plans (none party)
Topic: health-care,medicare

Analysis: Ultimately, AHIP's ad correctly communicates the facts about the size of the proposed Medicare Advantage cuts and their effect on beneficiaries. But the trade group spins these facts to their advantage and leaves out important context. The ad does not specify that cuts to Medicare Advantage would be made to extra benefits provided by insurers under Medicare Advantage, not to core benefits, which will remain untouched. In addition, it says that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are taking a hit that's ""more than their share""  an assertion that glosses over the fact that the government is currently paying 14 percent more for their coverage than it does for beneficiaries of traditional Medicare."
"Statement: Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nations leader in that area.
Speaker: dream-defenders (none party)
Topic: children,crime,education

Analysis: Dream Defenders said, ""Over 12,000 school kids were arrested in Florida. It makes Florida the nation's leader in that area. ""The number about Florida is correct: There were 12,520 students arrested at schools in 2011-12, according to the state Department of Juvenile Justice. But the Dream Defenders failed to prove that the number makes Florida the nations leader in school-related arrests. This appears to be a case of the state getting a bad rap because of its rare decision to publish comprehensive data. Multiple experts said that comprehensive data for state-by-state comparisons is lacking. That makes it difficult to declare Floridas ranking for school-related arrests."
"Statement: If Texas were a country our economy would rank # 10...in the WORLD.
Speaker: greg-abbott (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,economy,states

Analysis: Abbott said that if Texas were a country, its economy would rank 10th in the world. Thats so, figures show, if you leave out a bigger state, California. Considering California, in fairness, Texas would rank 11th in the world."
"Statement: There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined.

Analysis: David Cicilline said, ""There are more oil rigs in operation in the United States than the rest of the world combined. ""He said that information comes from ""the best available data"" in February. He's relying on a count that excludes some of the largest producers of oil and gas in the world, calling that the ""best available data.

"Statement: Payday lenders profit from the poor by charging 1,000-plus percent interest.
Speaker: wendy-davis (democrat party)
Topic: financial-regulation

Analysis: Davis said payday lenders charge 1,000-plus percent interest. The effective annual rate of such loans in Texas, taking into account uncapped fees, can exceed 1,000 percent, but thats not been common. For three months in 2012, the average effective annual rate for payday loans repaid in multiple installments exceeded 1,000 percent. Yet average effective rates for such loans were otherwise lower, while such rates for considerably more prevalent single-installment loans topped out at an average of 465 percent."
"Statement: The Social Security trust fund is sound. Without anything being done, it would function well into 2038; and even after that time with no changes, we could pay 80 percent of the benefits that people have earned.
Speaker: marcy-kaptur (democrat party)

"Statement: The Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert program because of the government shutdown.
Speaker: tweets (none party)
Topic: children,crime,federal-budget

Analysis: People on Twitter, bloggers and others said the Obama administration shut down the Amber Alert system. Actually, each state has its own alert system, and national coordination takes place through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private nonprofit, untouched by the federal stalemate. The system has continued to operate through the federal shutdown, sending out alerts in Texas and Florida."
"Statement: The Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote.
Speaker: tamara-holder (none party)
Topic: religion

Analysis: We found that roughly 8 to 11 percent of Muslims consider themselves Republicans. Muslims voted overwhelmingly for John Kerry during the 2004 election, and at least one post-election analysis shows that McCain only received 2 percent of the vote in the 2008 election. Still,that's quite low compared to the support that Democrats have, so Holder's underlying point that Republicans lack significant Muslim backing is valid."
"Statement: [W]e see Americas prison population exploding, with America having a greater percentage of its people behind bars than any other nation in the world!
Speaker: hank-johnson (democrat party)
Topic: criminal-justice

Analysis: ""It is, however, entirely accurate to state that the United States has the highest reported incarceration rate, as well as the highest total prison population, based on the most recent studies. ""The United States has the highest percentage of people in its prisons of any nation that can be verified. From the most recent numbers weve seen, the U. S.  may have a higher percentage than one nation (Cuba) we thought had more of its people in prison. Well give Johnson a higher grade this time on the Truth-O-Meter but still leave room for another country (North Korea, perhaps) that may have a higher percentage of its people in prison."

Analysis: The pro-minimum-wage group said in a Facebook meme that ""every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015. ""That is what would happen if Congress fails to affirmatively reject a raise. But there is hardly a guarantee that lawmakers would simply go along with this pay hike. Accepting a pay raise is so politically unpopular that Congress has rejected such an increase for five years running."
"Statement: In Texas, the No. 1 name for new male babies many of whom will vote one day is Jose.

Analysis: In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael. In case you're wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava.

Analysis: Clinton said, ""Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people. ""Rubio did vote against the specific resolution for an airstrike campaign, explaining he was ""unconvinced it will work. ""But he supported a subsequent plan for the United States to help moderate Syrian rebels lead the fight, an idea he had been promoting for a while. The Clinton statement suggests a reluctance by Rubio to intervene in Syria when, in fact, it's the type of involvement that's at issue. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information."

Analysis: And the bill says anyone who knowingly violates the provisions of the program could face a fine of up to $15,000. The wording in the legislation makes this one an easy call for us.

Topic: cap-and-trade,climate-change,debates,economy,energy,environment,government-regulation,jobs,campaign-advertising,polls,public-safety

Analysis: Sanders said, ""Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real. ""In fact, we found four GOP presidential candidates who have said it is real, it's man-made, and they have offered support for actions to deal with it. Whether their proposed actions  or the actions proposed by Sanders  are the best way of tackling the problem is a matter for debate."
"Statement: While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: economy,income,workers

Analysis: In his ad, Sanders asserts that, ""While our people work longer hours for lower wages, almost all new income goes to the top 1 percent. ""The question of hours is a mixed bag. The individual data suggest that people work the same or fewer hours. But family data analyzed by Brookings and only showing a limited slice of the population show that mothers are working longer hours. Wages have, in general, been going up, although barely at all compared to the gains seen among the rich. And while the super-rich may have accumulated 91 percent of the new wealth from 2009 to 2013 according to the economist Sanders has been relying on, the latest analysis shows that the ratio is now 58 percent since 2009, 55 percent since 1993. That's a huge amount of new income for just 1 percent of the population, but it's a stretch to say that it's ""almost all."
"Statement: David Dewhurst has a record of promoting an income tax.

"Statement: Point Pleasant Beach does not own its beaches; they are privately owned and operated by businesses such as Jenkinsons
Speaker: vincent-barrella (independent party)
Topic: environment,income

Analysis: Manasquan, which has a utility to operate its beach, took in $1,793,000 from beach badges in 2010 for the same period as Belmar; and was at $1,695,000 just before Hurricane Irene hit the Jersey Shore, according to Beach Department manager/beach manager Walter Wall. Our ruling    Barrella says the boroughs beaches are privately owned and operated by various businesses in town. While Jenkinsons and others do own most of the beachfront, the borough owns slightly more than an acre of prime real estate: the Maryland Avenue beach."
"Statement: In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there.
Speaker: alan-grayson (democrat party)
Topic: afghanistan

Analysis: But that 20 percent number represents displeasure with Obama and not the dropoff in support for the war, which is at just 11 percent."
"Statement: In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Speaker: lamar-smith (republican party)
Topic: crime,homeland-security,immigration

Analysis: Then that's what Smith should have said in the first place. First, he misleads by failing to specify that all the deaths he is talking about were on the Mexican side of the border."
"Statement: The state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation.
Speaker: bill-johnson (republican party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: But monthly stats for March and April, both available at the time of his statement, showed Ohio losing jobs. And while Ohios jobless rate has improved considerably since it rose above 10 percent in 2009 and 2010, it is not one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. It now is below the national average."
"Statement: Says Obama health reform law denies millions access to affordable insurance.
Speaker: eric-hovde (republican party)
Topic: health-care,workers

Analysis: In the scenarios he cites, it is the employer who would be deciding to drop the employer-sponsored plan. Our rating    Hovde said Obamas health care reform law denies ""millions of Americans access to affordable"" health insurance. Once the law takes full effect, some employers are expected to stop providing health insurance to their employees. But that's not the same as the law denying people access to affordable health insurance, particularly since other options for obtaining such insurance will be available."
"Statement: Says HB2 hasnt moved the needle one iota on North Carolinas economy.
Speaker: john-skvarla (republican party)
Topic: corporations,economy,gays-and-lesbians,state-finances,states

Analysis: On a macro scale, however, Skvarla has a point. Even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses wont dent the states GDP very much. And the now-canceled jobs would not have had much of an impact on the overall unemployment rate. Yet many local economies  particularly in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the states two largest  have felt the sting of hundreds of jobs, providing tens of millions of dollars in annual wages. That would have helped the economy. So would the tens of thousands of sports fans who will now spend their money in other states."
"Statement: Close to 30% of our federal prison population consists of illegal immigrants.
Speaker: daniel-mielke (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: So, in his statement did Mielke cross the border between fact and fiction?He took what was an easy-to-verify fact -- the number of non-citizens who are guests of Uncle Sam in the federal prison system -- to make a political point. But instead of going to the source, he relied on an unattributed comment on a political talk show. In doing so, he missed the correct figure by a little and missed some key nuances by a lot."
"Statement: Says Rick Scott called education not a core function of the state.

Analysis: The Florida Democratic Party said in a press release that Scott called education ""not a core function of the state. ""The Democrats point to Scotts 2011 comments about his budget proposal that included massive and wide-ranging cuts -- including to education. Scott called for focusing on ""core functions"" of the state. Scott cut the education budget in a year when he talked about funding for ""core functions. ""But he never specifically said education was not a ""core function."
"Statement: The Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group.

Analysis: Carson said, ""the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group. ""The Family Research Council has been labeled an ""extremist"" group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but thats not the same as a ""terrorist"" group and, more importantly, the center is a private, non-profit group, not a government agency. We could find no government agency that singled out the Family Research Council as a terrorist group, and experts told us they were unaware of any government lists that did."
"Statement: Says Rep. Jim Weidner proposed a bill taking away health care for 80,000 of Oregons children.

Analysis: So where does that leave us?Well, while were feeling pretty confident that Weidner isnt anti-health care for kids, he did, as the website alleges, propose a bill that would have eliminated the funding for health care for 80,000 children. Whether he thought it would pass or not doesnt much change things. And some context about how he was really targeting a tax would have been nice."
"Statement: Says that in the 1985 election former Gov. Tom Kean had the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history.
Speaker: raymond-bateman (republican party)

Analysis: Bateman said that in the 1985 general election Kean had ""the largest winning margin for a gubernatorial candidate in Jersey history. ""Kean trounced his opponent that year. The former Republican governor won more than 1. 37 million votes, compared with the roughly 578,000 ballots cast for his Democratic rival. That means Kean won by more than 790,000 votes. Thats the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial election in New Jerseys history."
"Statement: Obamacare is the biggest tax increase in American history.
Speaker: mark-neumann (republican party)

"Statement: The median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation adjusted, for 30 years, basically.
Speaker: rana-foroohar (none party)
Topic: economy,jobs,labor,workers

Analysis: Foroohar said, ""the median male worker in this country has not seen a raise, inflation-adjusted, for 30 years, basically. ""Federal data for 1982-2012 shows a slight increase, though the numbers show the real value of median male earnings have been in the range of $46,840-$51,670for about 40 years. We found another point of view that says the real median income has declined significantly once men without jobs are factored in. We also found a broader definition of income that changes the dynamic. Still, Foroohar clearly has a point."
"Statement: Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett has held the line on property taxes.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: job-accomplishments,taxes

Analysis: President Obamas statement ignores the shift of items from the property tax to fees, with total revenue collected from the four main fees more than doubling under Barrett. So city property owners are hit with that increase, on top of the higher property taxes."
"Statement: Im the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200.

Analysis: Grayson said, ""Im the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200. ""Graysons small donations equaled 57 percent of his donations during the most recent cycle, putting him ahead of second-place finisher Wasserman Schultz at 47 percent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics."
"Statement: Unlike the gridlock in Washington, more than 80 percent of the bills we passed during this General Assembly had bipartisan support.
Speaker: tom-niehaus (republican party)
Topic: bipartisanship,job-accomplishments

Analysis: The actual numbers showed about 79 percent had bipartisan support. The senators point was that the two parties worked together and avoided gridlock. And since the threshold for bipartisanship is that a majority of Democrats support the bill, there clearly was bipartisan support for a significant amount of legislation."
"Statement: Josh Mandel is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohios investment fund has NOT improved.

"Statement: Rick Scott took $200,000 from a family that leased land for drilling and now he is trying to hide from it.
Speaker: nextgen-climate (organization party)

Analysis: A NextGen ad says Rick Scott took $200,000 from the Collier family who leased their land for oil drilling ""and now he is trying to hide from it. ""For its part, NextGens charge that Scott is trying to ""hide from"" the Collier donations is exaggerated. Quite the contrary -- it has been discussed widely in media reports. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details."
"Statement: On how money from a possible lease of the Ohio Turnpike would be used
Speaker: john-kasich (republican party)
Topic: infrastructure,transportation

Analysis: Kasich is sensitive to their concerns. His administration has tried to ease the tension by dispatching ODOT officials to the area to assure leaders in Northern Ohio, where the turnpike stretches from Pennsylvania to Indiana, that proceeds from the deal will be spent on infrastructure projects around the turnpike and that any private operator would be held to standards to maintain the reputation of the toll road. If the governor is beginning to hedge a bit, that is a concern for local leaders who believe a lease agreement is inevitable but took some comfort in expecting proceeds to be spent on roads and bridges. Kasich says he is still committed to spending lease dollars on infrastructure but has clearly left the door ajar for other spending opportunities."
"Statement: At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget

Analysis: The CBO bases its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law. So, Obama's overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed; he's spot on about the surplus Bush began with. He's also correct about the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology."
"Statement: The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated.
Speaker: mitch-mcconnell (republican party)
Topic: legal-issues

Analysis: McConnell said Obama faced no real problems getting his nominees confirmed by the Senate, saying that only four of 1,540 nominations had been defeated. His office later said he misspoke and the number should have been 1,560. We find he's partially accurate but is leaving out some important details. But this accounting ignores those who withdrew before a vote, including the estimated 38 who withdrew after Republican opposition. It also does not account for high-profile figures such as Susan Rice who were never nominated because of opposition."
"Statement: U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East.
Speaker: ileana-ros-lehtinen (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,religion,terrorism

Analysis: But while we're not taking sides on the fundraising question, we believe that the less-far-reaching statement by Ros-Lehtinenis accurate. U. S.  taxpayers are indeed funding Raufs trip, as they have his prior two trips to the region. It's worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention, and also that Rauf took his first State Department-funded trip during the Bush administrationrather than Barack Obama. But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros-Lehtinen."
"Statement: Milwaukee County taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle a lawsuit over a decision by Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. to use untrained corrections officers rather than deputies to patrol the lakefront.
Speaker: chris-moews (democrat party)
Topic: labor,public-safety

Analysis: I dont think they wanted that amount to get out there. ""The union filed and won two complaints regarding the move to corrections officers, and county taxpayers paid $370,000 to settle one of them."
"Statement: There are Justice Department policies against FBI Director James Comey discussing details of a federal investigation so close to an election.
Speaker: robby-mook (democrat party)
Topic: criminal-justice,government-regulation

Analysis: Mook said, ""There are Justice Department policies against doing something like this so close to an election. ""The department prohibits its employees from interfering with elections. That policy generally has included being sensitive about what information is released about pending or active investigations in the days and weeks leading up to the election. However, there is no hard and fast rule, and an expert said Comey has the ability to exercise his judgment based on the facts as he knows them."
"Statement: Democratic presidents ""have been considerably more effective at creating private-sector jobs.""
Speaker: carolyn-maloney (democrat party)
Topic: economy,history,workers

Analysis: ""Obviously, luck matters a lot, but when there is a consistent pattern over more than 60 years, it starts to look like more than just luck. ""Kevin Hassett, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former economic adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of George W.  Bush and John McCain, argued that the best way to evaluate presidents is to look at their policies. Still, he added, calculations like Maloney's ""are worth doing. They can be thought-provoking and can ignite debates that help inform."
"Statement: Joe Biden ""voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq.""
Speaker: lindsey-graham (republican party)
Topic: iraq

Analysis: That resolution was defeated 46-53, with Biden voting in favor. On the campaign trail, Biden makes the case that he has the requisite toughness to go head-to-head with foreign leaders. As an example, he points to a 1993 encounter with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic duiring the Balkan wars in which he called Milosevic a war criminal to his face. But Biden's two votes on the eve of war in 1991 clearly show he favored continued economic sanctions over the use of military force."
"Statement: Says Rush Limbaugh made it clear hed rather see the country fail than President Barack Obama succeed.
Speaker: mark-strama (democrat party)
Topic: bipartisanship

Analysis: Strama said Limbaugh made it clear hed rather see the country fail than Obama succeed. Limbaugh has been clear about hoping Obama and his policies fail. Far as we can tell, though, he has not said he would prefer that the country fails, though Strama openly infers as much."
"Statement: One percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasnt the way before George Bush became president.
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)

"Statement: Military ""recruiting went on at Harvard every single day throughout the time (Kagan) was there.""
Speaker: patrick-leahy (democrat party)
Topic: kagan-nomination,military,abc-news-week

Analysis: The comment suggests it was business as usual for military recruiters on the Harvard Law School campus. The letter from the student veterans association indicates that was not the case. The limitations described in the letter indicate the organization was not equipped or able to make sure that recruiting went on at Harvard ""every single day. ""Leahy's comment also ignores some important context: namely, that there was a raging legal battle over the extent of the recruiting."
"Statement: Says that under Rick Perrys plan, Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25%.
Speaker: fix-austin-schools (none party)
Topic: children,education,state-budget,state-finances

Analysis: The pro-bonds group said that under Perrys education plan, Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25 percent. State education spending in 2012 was 25 percent lower than it was in 2002, adjusting for inflation and the real effects of the 2006 law giving the state more responsibility for education revenues. Yet Perry didnt cause the reduction by himself; lawmakers acted, too."
"Statement: Says David Perdue wants to abolish the U.S. Department of Education, which would cost Georgia schools $1 billion a year and eliminate millions in student loans.
Speaker: democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee (democrat party)
Topic: education,federal-budget

Analysis: Our research finds there is reason to believe Perdue does support abolishing the department and transferring funding to the local level. But it is alarmist to suggest the end of the department would be the end of all K-12 money. And suggestions that it would mean the end of student loan programs ignores the history that has already shuffled their administration."
"Statement: The Paul Ryan budget proposal would privatize Medicare.
Speaker: agenda-project (none party)
Topic: federal-budget,health-care,medicare

Analysis: But ""privatization"" does not have to mean that the government has nothing further to do with the enterprise. Under longstanding definitions, privatization could take place without the government giving up its right to regulate a privately provided service, such as an electric utility. That said, we think its fair to note that Medicare already provides some types of coverage through private insurance now, so the shift toward the private sector prompted by the Ryan plan would be more a question of degree than kind."
"Statement: High school students arrested on campus are twice as likely not to graduate and four times less likely to graduate if theyve appeared in court.

"Statement: Says Marco Rubio is the one for an open border.
Speaker: rand-paul (republican party)

Analysis: Paul said that Rubio ""is the one for an open border. ""An open border allows people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. Rubio doesnt support anything like that. He was one of the authors of a 2013 bill that included billions for border security and more border agents. After that bill died in the House, Rubio has repeatedly said that the border must be secured before the Senate can revisit changing immigration laws."
"Statement: ...Over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat.
Speaker: dave-brat (republican party)
Topic: education,federal-budget

Analysis: Brat says that ""over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat. ""The inflation-adjusted figure Brat uses to describe what he sees as runaway federal spending on education over 30 years is overblown. You can only get near a 375 percent increase if you start in 1970 and end in 2010, when U. S.  school funding was nearly doubled with stimulus money and stood at an all-time high of $73. 3 billion. Uncle Sam spent $40. 8 billion on public schools last year. When you divide that by enrollment, it comes to $816 a student. Adjusted for inflation, thats a 117 percent increase in federal spending per student over 30 years ago. That said, the increase in per-student spending is still significant and Brat has valid point on the test results. Average NAEP scores for 17-year-olds have barely budged during the last 30 years of testing."
"Statement: Says cuts to Medicare affect people who have already paid in. We paid for it.
Speaker: national-republican-senatorial-committee (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,health-care,medicare

Analysis: The ad says that cuts to Medicare affect people who have already ""paid in. While Americans have indeed ""paid in"" to Medicare, the amount that todays beneficiaries have paid in only covers a fraction of their expected costs. The taxes paid by todays typical beneficiaries will cover just 13 percent to 41 percent of what those beneficiaries can expect to get from Medicare during their lifetime. The rest of what has been ""paid in"" for their care has come from younger Americans."

"Statement: Says you need a photo ID to purchase Sudafed in Texas.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: elections,legal-issues

Analysis: If the purchaser lacks such an ID, other types may be used, such as a U. S.  passport, certain unexpired foreign passports, a school ID card with a photograph or voter registration card, among alternatives. The Texas law requires a business making an over-the-counter sale of a product containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or norpseudoephedrine to make the purchaser show a drivers license or other form of photo ID that indicates the person is 16 or older. Dodson noted, too, that legislators in 2011 amended the law to specify that the presented IDs must be government-issued. Upshot: Perrys Sudafed statement reflects both state and federal ID requirements."
"Statement: Twenty percent of housing in Portlands Pearl District is affordable.

Analysis: Dave Davis, president of the Pearl District Neighborhood Association, concurs that Tanner Creek is solidly within his groups boundaries. In fact, the residential Pearl District stretches from Burnside to the river, and Broadway to Interstate-405, according to a map.

"Statement: Says allowing the payroll tax holiday to expire would end up costing another estimated 900,000 jobs in 2012.
Speaker: jeff-merkley (democrat party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Merkleys analysis conforms with traditional economic thinking and he is supported by actual calculations from economists. But questions of cause and effect in the economy always must be qualified as simply best educated guesses. Merkley adds the proper fudge in his letter, saying the job loss totals are estimates. In a world where absolutes are rare, Merkleys statement passes the sniff test."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA and permanent China trade. Pennsylvania lost thousands of jobs.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: Another study by EPI concluded Pennsylvania lost another 44,173 jobs between 1993 and 2004 due to NAFTA. But while the Obama campaign mailer tries to make it seem as though the two Democratic candidates are far apart on trade issues, in substance they are not."
"Statement: Numerous studies have shown that these so-called right-to-work laws do not generate jobs and economic growth.
Speaker: sheila-oliver (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,unions

Analysis: Right-to-work states have seen greater job increases, but one economist pointed out that such a dynamic doesnt prove right-to-work laws were the cause. Another professor who believes job growth results from right-to-work laws acknowledged that many other factors also could be responsible."
"Statement: Obama's budget plan would take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. ... Historically, it's been about 40 percent.
Speaker: judd-gregg (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan  organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits, also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years, interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget. Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the ""out years"" of budget  projections because ""none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight  or 10 years from now. ""And Obama has said that making investments today in education, health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy, which presumably would create a better debt-to-GDP ratio. Gregg is on solid ground, relying on projections from the CBO, a highly respected, nonpartisan arm of Congress, about the long-term debt-to-GDP ratios."
"Statement: Says Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is over-exaggerated. She said she was satisfied with what was going on.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)

Analysis: Trump said Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is ""over-exaggerated,"" and, ""She said she was satisfied with what was going on. While Clinton has said problems at the VA have ""not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,"" she has also acknowledged systemic problems within the system and repeatedly urged reform so veterans can get care quickly."
"Statement: We now have driven (health care) costs down to the lowest theyve been in 50 years.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Clinton said during the debate, ""We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years. ""Although the rate of growth has been at historic lows, the actual per-person cost of health care has increased steadily over the last half century. Only the rate of decline has slowed, a very different measure. The Clinton campaign acknowledges that the candidate misspoke."
"Statement: President Barack Obama's ""initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber"" was to say that ""this was the act of an isolated extremist.""
Speaker: dick-cheney (republican party)
Topic: homeland-security,terrorism,abc-news-week

Analysis: Ultimately, Cheney is correct that Obama did use the words ""an isolated extremist"" in his first statement addressing the Christmas Day bombing attempt. But we think it's a stretch for Cheney to say that the phrase signals the president initially believed that Abdulmutallab had acted alone. Obama did expressly say that ""we do not yet have all the answers,"" and he reported that an investigation had been launched that would hold accountable ""all who were involved."
"Statement: Says Sen. Sherrod Brown admitted that his $787 billion stimulus law failed and after specifically attacking Republicans for wanting to lower Americans taxes, (he) now claims that his stimulus bill didnt do enough to lower taxes.

"Statement: The Charleston, S.C., shootershould have never been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,guns,homeland-security

Analysis: Clinton said the Charleston shooter ""should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough. ""Dylann Roof admitted to a drug offense a few weeks before he tried to buy a gun, so the FBI said he should have been denied one. However, it wasnt the three-day time limit by itself that undermined Roofs background check. There were clerical errors in the FBIs database that prevented the examiner from seeing Roofs drug admission. Clintons characterization misses some important information about Roofs case. Note to readers: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Roof ""admitted to a felony drug offense"" before attempting to buy a gun. That is not what the FBI news releasesaid. The release said that a police report about his arrest included Roof'sadmission to possessing illegal drugs, which Comey said would have been enough to deny the sale of the handgun."
"Statement: Sixty-five percent of the Iraqi people now say it's okay to shoot an American soldier.
Speaker: bill-richardson (democrat party)
Topic: iraq

Analysis: Richardson wasn't just ""juicing the numbers,"" as Geer said. He was deliberately hyping the language and hyping the numbers to make a stronger point than the facts justified."
"Statement: Twelve judges have thrown out legal challenges to the health care law because they rejected the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)

"Statement: Says Gov. Chris Christies proposal to reduce state income taxes would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years.
Speaker: paul-sarlo (democrat party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Sarlo was referring to Christie vetoing the proposed millionaires tax in 2010. But that veto just kept income tax rates at the same levels as when the governor took office."
"Statement: Warren (Buffett) still does support me.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: He's got, I think, exactly the right goals. He's articulate and I  you know, he will be the right person to be the commander in chief in this economic crisis. ""So clearly Obama was on solid ground touting Buffett's continued support."
"Statement: Says George LeMieux was one of two Republicans who voted for President Barack Obamas jobs bill.
Speaker: connie-mack (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,jobs

Analysis: Macks ad puts a lot of spin on the basic facts when it says, ""George LeMieux was one of only two liberal Republicans who voted for Barack Obamas liberal jobs bill that failed to help our economy. ""Certainly that ""liberal"" tag is what gives the ad its bite. Here, were simply checking whether LeMieux was one of two Republican senators who voted for a jobs bill supported by the president."
"Statement: A precinct in the Allen West-Patrick Murphy recount has 7 registered voters in Guatemalan community and the tally showed 900 voted!!!!!
Speaker: facebook-posts (none party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: A Palm Beach Post article paraphrased West campaign manager Tim Edson saying that, ""Preliminary totals showed 900 voters cast ballots in Precinct 93, where only seven voters are registered. ""A machine that had the label of Precinct 93 was actually counting votes from another precinct. In the end, only six people voted in Precinct 93, which has seven total voters."
"Statement: About 230,000 people that were on unemployment when I took office are not on unemployment now.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: economy,workers

Analysis: A couple of caveats here. The figure is not completely an indicator that the economy is improving, as Scott suggests, and is somewhat the result of a strict new state law. That undercuts, to a point, the suggestion Scott should get the credit. Scotts statement is accurate but can use some additional information."
"Statement: One person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die.
Speaker: rush-limbaugh (none party)
Topic: children,health-care,public-health,pundits

Analysis: Limbaugh said that ""one person, Kathleen Sebelius, was going to determine whether or not"" 10-year-old lung patient Sarah Murnaghan would live or die, essentially serving as a one-woman ""death panel. ""However, she was not the only person or entity that did -- existing rules, medical experts and a federal judge also played a role in Murnaghans case. In addition, Sebelius didnt have the power to grant or revoke life; many factors, including the availability and suitability of organs, will ultimately determine her likelihood of survival."
"Statement: Ron Klein repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants.
Speaker: allen-west (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: For Allen West to accuse Congressman Klein of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants is nothing more than an outright lie. ""Our conclusion here is crystal clear: West's campaign admits that it wrongly characterized Klein's views on amnesty, and it had done so in the 2008 campaign as well. Illegal immigration is a hot-button emotional topic."
"Statement: Local law enforcement . . . will have access to the [Obamacare] Data Hubs treasure trove of personal info.

Analysis: Evan Feinberg of Generation Opportunity said, ""Local law enforcement . . . will have access to the Data Hubs treasure trove of personal info"" in a database with ""private medical records, tax and financial info, legal history, and other intimate information. ""Not only is he making a huge stretch when he says the treasure trove includes private medical records and legal history -- with financial data, not so much -- he is stretching further to suggest that local police will have anything close to routine access to the data in the Hub."
"Statement: During his tenure as mayor, he saw Houstons crime rates drop to the lowest levels in more than 25 years.

"Statement: Terry McAuliffe wants to raise your taxes $1,700 to pay for his infinite promises.
Speaker: ken-cuccinelli (republican party)
Topic: education,state-budget,taxes

Analysis: Cuccinelli says McAuliffe wants to raise taxes by $1,700 annually for an average four-person family to pay for his ""promises. ""He assumes, for example, that McAuliffes statement that college graduates ""deserve the opportunity"" to start their careers without the burden of student debts is a promise that the state will pay off their loans, starting his first year in office. He assumes McAuliffes statement that ""its time"" to restore per-pupil funding in public schools to pre-recession levels is a vow to do that instantly. Then, Cuccinelli takes his assumptions and multiplies them by a stew of worst-case scenarios to come up with his unreliable tax estimate. We dont fault Cuccinelli for demanding specifics on McAuliffes agenda; the Democrat has addressed issues with a broad brush throughout the campaign. Its fair to ask how McAuliffe would accomplish his objectives and keep his word not to raise taxes. But that doesnt give Cuccinelli the license to create a platform for his rival."
"Statement: Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,women,workers

Analysis: Trumps post said, ""Hypocrisy at the Clinton Foundation: Top male staff made on average $218,029 while top female staff made $153,014 from 2010-2014. ""If you allow some leeway on what accounts for top staff, Trump is close on the numbers. Trump is guilty of ignoring the nuances of gender-based wage disparities, just as Democrats often over-simplify the meaning of the 77-cent figure."
"Statement: Since the federal Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent.
Speaker: gwen-moore (democrat party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice,women

Analysis: But experts debate over what factors are most responsible, she said. Our rating    U. S.  Rep.  Gwen Moore said that since the Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994, ""cases of domestic violence have fallen by 67 percent. ""Her statement is generally on the money, though a bit dated. It also needs some clarification -- namely that there are factors in addition to the law that are linked to the decrease."
"Statement: Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)
Topic: crime,homeland-security,legal-issues,terrorism,abc-news-week

Analysis: He is right that after the initial questioning, federal authorities stopped interrogating Abdulmutallab and then, ultimately, read him his Miranda rights. But Giuliani implied that authorities stopped the questioning in order to Mirandize him. After the treatment, he was read his rights, although the precisesequence of events isn't clear."
"Statement: On legalizing illegal immigrants.
Speaker: lou-dobbs (none party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: We have not been able to find statements in the past where Dobbs said specifically that he opposed amnesty. But he gave the distinct impression that he opposed it, and many people clearly thought he did oppose it. Now, at a minimum, Dobbs is significantly changing his tone on the issue."
"Statement: Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.
Speaker: edith-ajello (democrat party)
Topic: abortion,census,children,families,health-care,public-health,women

Analysis: Perry and Ajello stated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Two studies based on data from the U. S.  census and the CDC reported that the share of unintended pregnancies in the United States was 49 percent. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."
"Statement: We are ""borrowing Saudi money for Saudi oil"" with the result being ""dependency and debt.""
Speaker: john-mccain (republican party)
Topic: energy

Analysis: But the two phenomena aren't causally related. The Saudis aren't running a company store, where we're required to borrow from them to buy the product. Rather, these are two issues taking on new relevance because of dramatic increases in oil prices."
"Statement: Says there are homes for sale on and around (Oswego Lake) right now for under $150,000 that anyone is welcome to buy.
Speaker: doug-thomas (none party)
Topic: housing

Analysis: There are some condos with lake access that go for less than $150,000. But that price is hardly the norm. Those are important details -- and his statement ignores them."
"Statement: Since the president became the president, we have lost 3.3 million jobs in the private sector. But you know whos done OK and whos not complaining today? The public sector. Weve gained 590,000 public sector jobs.
Speaker: steve-latourette (republican party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget

Analysis: The distinction for the census is crucial here because it was LaTourette who said that ""as a result"" of stimulating the economy, the public sector gained 590,000 jobs. The government gained the jobs, but the stimulus had little to do with it. The hiring was planned before Obama became president, as were the rapid-fire census terminations occurring now ."
"Statement: The top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country.
Speaker: trent-franks (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: The top one-fifth of the population -- what one might call, in Franks' words, ""the rich"" -- is the only fifth, or ""quintile,"" of the population that has seen its share of the tax burden go up during that time. Still, we can't brush off the inaccuracies in Franks' statement. He makes it sound as if the top 1 percent of the country is shouldering more than half of the burden of funding the federal government, when in fact it's about half that. In addition, the top 1 percent are not even shouldering half of the burden of the income tax by itself."
"Statement: The difference over the (previous) four years between where things were headed and where we brought them to over the last four years is a total of $816 in saved property tax money.
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)

"Statement: Chris Christie has not increased the taxes on anyone.
Speaker: kim-guadagno (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Guadagno said about Christie in a speech to supporters in Carlstadt, """"He has not increased the taxes on anyone. In the eyes of some experts, thats still a tax increase."
"Statement: The United States does not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: agriculture,immigration,workers

Analysis: However, many farmers have complained that the visa program is inadequate, cumbersome and in dire need of a makeover. Also, the H-2A visa program is only for temporary seasonal labor. Rubio specifically mentioned dairies, and that is a type of farm that needs year-round workers."
"Statement: Says he never said he would keep education funding the same.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: education,state-budget

Analysis: Yes, it's a small cut from a proposed budget of $12. 3 billion, but it's a cut nevertheless. At the very least, Scott deliberately and purposely suggested that education funding would be held harmless in his first state budget. He made comments to that effect just days before his budget was released. Yet, when he announced his budget, cuts were included."
"Statement: Since 1978, college tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation.
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: For example, from 1990 until 2014, net tuition paid by in-state students at public four-year schools across the country doubled. In contrast, published tuition prices more than tripled during the same time period. Our rating Walker said since 1978, college ""tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation. ""Average tuition prices from the National Center for Education Statistics and inflation rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point."
"Statement: Says Sen. Rob Portman said, It would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare.
Speaker: ted-strickland (democrat party)
Topic: medicare

Analysis: Strickland said Portman went on television and said ""it would be irresponsible not to cut Medicare. Those were not Portman's exact words on Cavuto's show. Portman said it would be irresponsible of any fellow senators to argue that Medicare would be off the table when discussing cutting entitlements. Strickland made it sound as if Portman was singling out Medicare by itself."
"Statement: Most of, if not all of, the [DeKalb school construction] projects always came in on or were under budget.
Speaker: thomas-brown (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Woods also defended the quality of the work, which has been a concern of some DeKalb parents who closely watch the districts spending. He did say some subcontractors have been late in meeting deadlines. The DeKalb school districts spreadsheet and what we saw ourselves backs up much of Thomas Browns argument. The recession has apparently helped lower bid prices -- even though a few projects were still seriously over budget."
"Statement: (Palin) supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000.
Speaker: moveon (democrat party)
Topic: israel

Analysis: Buchanan doesn't say that anymore. We may never be sure of Palin's position in 1996, but if she says she wasn't a Buchanan supporter and Buchanan says he can't prove that she was, we don't have much to go on. But for our purposes, the question of 2000 is more important because that's what Moveon. org alleges in a widespread e-mail. The letter to the editor that Palin wrote back in 1999 seems pretty clear to us."
"Statement: Says Sen. Sherrod Brown voted to block American energy production and increase energy taxes.
Speaker: us-chamber-commerce (none party)
Topic: energy,message-machine-2012,taxes

Analysis: And the Chamber argues that Browns opposition to establishing a parliamentary ""point of order"" against debating energy tax legislation means that he ""supports raising energy taxes. ""But thats not what that vote was about. His vote indicates that he wouldnt bar discussion of such ideas, not that he supports them."
"Statement: Says Jeanne Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax.
Speaker: scott-brown (republican party)
Topic: energy,taxes,voting-record

Analysis: Browns campaign said that Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax. The campaign cited Shaheens support for a 2013 amendment that would have established guidelines for any future carbon tax. They also pointed to Shaheens vote against legislation that would have made it harder to pass a carbon tax framework. One of her major legislative efforts, the Shaheen-Portman bill, focused on energy efficiency. Brown has a point that Shaheen voted for a revenue plan offered by a carbon tax supporter and shrugged off a proposal from a carbon tax opponent. Still, neither of those positions is the same as voting for a new energy tax."
"Statement: Washington, D.C., had some of the strictest gun laws in the country. And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice,drugs,government-regulation,guns,public-safety

Analysis: Rubio, expressing his disappointment in Obamas recent actions to prevent gun violence, argued they wouldnt solve the problem. ""Washington, D. C.  had some of the strictest gun laws in the country,"" he said. ""And when they passed them, violence skyrocketed. ""Crime statistics dont support Rubios simple story. Rather than skyrocket, violent crime rose and fell, rose and fell. Other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. And one peer-reviewed study about gun laws role in violent crime through 1987 showed they reduced homicides and suicides. Rubios statement is partially accurate  in some years, violent crime in the District of Columbia did rise even with a handgun ban in place  but leaves out important details and context."
"Statement: Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.
Speaker: julian-castro (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,history

Analysis: Castro said that ""seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans. ""Its a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and its possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage ""to all Americans."
"Statement: While fighting a move to toughen penalties for workplace gender discrimination, state Sen. Glenn Grothman said he didnt believe women belonged in the workplace but belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies.
Speaker: christine-sinicki (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,legal-issues,women

Analysis: Our conclusion    In arguing against repeal of an anti-gender-bias bill, Sinicki summoned up her memory of comments by Grothman when the Legislature debated the original bill in 2007. Grothman did speak up for families where the woman has chosen to stay home to raise children. But thats a far cry from him saying the whole world should do that, and that women ""belong"" at home."
"Statement: If you put the $47 billion in revenue (raised over 10 years by the Buffett rule) into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs.
Speaker: sheldon-whitehouse (democrat party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,jobs,transportation

Analysis: U. S.  Sen.  Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year. Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely. To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections. Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."

"Statement: I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: And the Latino community as well as the African-American community was particularly hard hit when it comes to foreclosures. ""On Feb.  19, 2008, Obama was at a campaign event in San Antonio, Texas, and discussed the need for people having mortgage problems to receive help negotiating with their lenders. ""My suspicion is that it's very important we have Spanish-speaking counselors because I know that both the African-American community and Hispanic community have been disproportionately targeted by some of these practices."

Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: energy

Analysis: Then, the national average for a gallon of gas was $4. 108, less than a penny off the all-time high of $4. 114 on July 14. Back on July 7, Obama set the bar at ""genuine emergency,"" and then cited an example of a catastrophic disruption in supply. Obama is now describing the high price of gas as a crisis and a threat to national security. But we fail to see how that's any different than was the case a month ago  when the price of gas was 24 cents a gallon higher  when Obama dismissed it."
"Statement: Immigrants are more fertile.
Speaker: jeb-bush (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Bush said that immigrants are more fertile and the data back him up. National statistics show that birth rates among foreign-born residents are about 50 percent higher than for U. S. -born women. However, the rates are converging, they vary widely among immigrant groups and over the years, the rates change."
"Statement: The proposed education changes ""will not cut one teacher's pay.""
Speaker: florida-chamber-commerce (none party)
Topic: education

Analysis: The chamber is right that there's nothing in the education bills that cuts teachers' pay. But teacher salaries could fluctuate in the new performance pay system when compared with the system currently in place. And there is a fear among school district administrators that the cost to implement the SB 6/HB 7189 changes might result in less money to be directed to teacher salaries."
"Statement: The number of uninsured people in Massachusetts is about the same as it was when the mandates were passed in 2006.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: health-care,states

Analysis: Based on the American Community Survey, a more reliable source of state data than the CPS because the surveys are sent to more households, about 263,000 people in Massachusetts lacked health insurance in 2008. (That was the first year the ACS included a question about health insurance coverage. )However you do the the Massachusetts math, the number of people without health insurance has dropped by at least 300,000 since 2006  not the ""about the same"" that Perry airs in his column. So where does this leave Perry's statement?After we'd visited with officials elsewhere, a Perry aide told us by e-mail Monday that the governor's statement was ""an error."
"Statement: Firearms homicides are down about 40 percent since Texas passed concealed-gun permit law.
Speaker: jerry-patterson (republican party)
Topic: civil-rights,crime,guns

Analysis: Patterson said firearms homicides decreased 40 percent since Texas passed a law permitting licensed residents to carry concealed guns. Still, Pattersons figure is close to correct. Data for Texas show declines of either 32 percent or 42 percent since the state law took effect. We are not concluding that the measure authored by Patterson explains the decrease, which occurred nationally for multiple reasons."
"Statement: Upwards of 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound.

"Statement: We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor.
Speaker: newt-gingrich (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Gingrich tweeted that the country now spends less on defense as a percentage of the GDP than at any time since the start of World War II. Thats a firm statement, but since the Cold War ended, and in a few other years as well, the percent of GDP used for defense has been consistently lower than current spending levels. Gingrich gets our lowest rating on this one."
"Statement: If you got rid of the income tax today you'd have about as much revenue as we had 10 years ago.
Speaker: ron-paul (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: We'll concede that it's possible Paul could reduce the budget by that much, based on some of the positions he advocates. Paul has said he'd like to slash the defense budget by pulling back all U. S.  troops on foreign soil, zeroing out foreign aid and reducing the size of the active military. He also advocates abolishing other federal functions, like the Department of Education. Whether he makes up that 12 percent difference or not will have to wait for a Paul presidency."
"Statement: Says Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill.

"Statement: Jason Kander supports [Obamas] plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil.
Speaker: roy-blunt (republican party)
Topic: terrorism

Analysis: Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldnt find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U. S.    Blunt is going against the message from his fellow Republicans when he says Kander supported Obamas plan in the past. Our Ruling   Blunt says Kander supports Obamas plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U. S.  Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesnt mean he supported Obamas plan to close the prison. He took no official position until February, and even the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they werent sure where he stood before then."
"Statement: Shelby County donated Im sorry, gave 44 schools to the city of Memphis.
Speaker: chris-thomas (republican party)
Topic: education,infrastructure

Analysis: So did Shelby County in fact ""give"" 44 school buildings to Memphis City Schools?As the consultants note, exactly $0. 00 in real dollars has exchanged hands for the buildings MCS took over during annexations. But there were serious past negotiations where the county received considerations of real value, even if it never got a check. Some of the suburban municipalities, in fact, benefitted from new schools or renovations made possible by Memphis agreeing to ""credit"" the county for some value of schools it took over."

Speaker: lindsey-graham (republican party)
Topic: iraq,terrorism

Analysis: Graham said that four top administration officials have said ""were about to be attacked in a serious way because (of) the threat emanating from Syria and Iraq. ""Grahams office sent quotations from three of the four. While each of them voiced strong concern about attacks on American soil, the role of ISIS was more indirect and less immediate than Graham would have us believe. The government officials spoke of the conflict in Syria as a training ground. Johnson, the Homeland Security director, also cast the Syrian civil war as a cause that could inspire ""lone wolf"" terrorists in the mode of the Boston Marathon bombers. The government officialstalked about the ""aspirations"" of some al-Qaida veterans and the steps they were taking to track the people who posed the greatest risk. They spoke of taking the threat seriously, but their words fell well short of Grahams phrase that,""were about to be attacked in a serious way."

Analysis: DeKalb County's population is slightly more than 747,000, the Census Bureau data show. Even if all 1,400 of those people moved to one of those counties, is it fair to say one of those places has been ""inundated"" with former AHA tenants?The data from the AHA and Georgia State both reach similar conclusions that the percentage of tenants moving out of the city has been small."
"Statement: In July 1996, Mitt Romney helped locate the missing teenage daughter of a partner at Bain Capital.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: . . . "" ""She was not harmed,"" Robert Gay said at news conference after she was found, according to the New York Daily News. We just gave her hugs and brought her back home. ""By all accounts, the effort by Bain employees was central to the effort to locate the girl, and Romney reportedly played a significant role in that effort."
"Statement: Blames Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi for the second straight year of no cost-of-living increases for Social Security beneficiaries.
Speaker: national-republican-congressional-committee (republican party)
Topic: message-machine,social-security

Analysis: The simpler explanation -- and the one that we think most viewers would take away from the ad -- is that McIntyre and Pelosi had something directly to do with eliminating a cost-of-living increase for two consecutive years in the first place. Even though the ad carefully avoids an explicit accusation that McIntyre and Pelosi voted to eliminate the COLA, we think the ad implies otherwise."
"Statement: The government is going to have the right to get into your bank account with the health care bill and make transfers without you knowing it.

Analysis: If you sign up for electronic withdrawal, you know about it."
"Statement: There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately.
Speaker: andrew-napolitano (republican party)
Topic: infrastructure

Analysis: The experts we spoke with told us that it is technically possible for large service providers to severely limit Internet connectivity. Moreover, there are both formal and informal channels for network operators who manage the Internet backbone to communicate with each other in times of emergencies. Still, there was disagreement among our experts on how difficult it would be for ISPs to coordinate with one another and whether the government would have to get involved. It is clear, however, that the government would have to participate in order to shut down its own networks, and there is an argument to be made that ""shutting down the Internet"" might hurt the response to a cyber attack more than it would help."
"Statement: The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Rubio said, ""The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government. ""Rubio makes it sound like he has support from the public for his main objective, which is defunding Obamacare. When asking the public about Obamacare, word choice matters, and ""defund"" leads to a different result than ""repeal. ""While the law isnt popular, a recent Kaiser poll found 57 percent opposed cutting off funding. On his second point, hes right that most people tell pollsters they dont want a government shutdown. But well point out that both sides in the budget battle in Congress say they dont want a shutdown."
"Statement: Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,social-security

Analysis: Rubios tweet did not make it clear that GOP leadership did pursue the Social Security change, at least for a time. Rubio also stated ""BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama. ""Obama has shown a willingness to use chained CPI as one ingredient in deficit reduction, though he acknowledges that it isnt popular with seniors or his own party. Obama has also said it was a concession he was willing to offer as part of a deal where both sides would compromise to reduce the deficit."

Analysis: Kaufman told usthat her reference to ""the cow"" was about Maddow -- the MSNBC commentator who played the clip of Kaufman. ""I endearingly call her Rachel Mad-cow,"" Kaufman said. We found several news articles quoting Obama as saying exactly that and he's never denied it (though the Chicago Tribune said it was meant as a joke)."
"Statement: The people of Rhode Island dont want same-sex marriage.
Speaker: christopher-plante (newsmaker party)
Topic: civil-rights,gays-and-lesbians,marriage,polls

Analysis: Not only did the trends in the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls show opposition to same-sex marriage evaporating, the Brown and RI-GLAD polls showed that the public wants gay couples to have the right to marry, even if you assume that every voter who didn't express an opinion was opposed to gay marriage."
"Statement: Rep. Paul Ryans Medicare plan lines the pockets of the private insurance companies, increases costs for seniors and does not reduce the deficit.
Speaker: gerry-connolly (democrat party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget,medicare,taxes

Analysis: Lets review:    The liberal economists dont like Ryans plan and say it would harm seniors, but they concede it would lead to lower government spending on health care costs, at least over time. That contradicts Connollys assertion that no money from these increased costs would help pay down the deficit."
"Statement: This year in Congress (Connie Mack IV) has missed almost half of his votes.
Speaker: dave-weldon (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: The Weldon robocall said that Connie Mack ""missed almost half of his votes"" this year. The Weldon campaign conceded that they relied on out-of-date information for their attack. However, Mack has missed votes. He's missed more votes than the average member of the U. S.  House of Representatives, and he's missed high-profile votes on health care and the budget. He hasn't missed ""almost half of his votes,"" though."
"Statement: 1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career.
Speaker: jeb-bush (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,education

Analysis: Bush said that ""1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career. ""Traditional dropout figures peg the dropout rate at 3 percent to 6 percent, and even the most generous failure-to-graduate figures are running no higher than 22 percent for the U.

"Statement: Not even old Gen. Eisenhower saluted military personnel as president.
Speaker: rachel-maddow (none party)
Topic: history,military

Analysis: Maddow wrote, ""Not even old Gen.  Eisenhower  saluted military personnel"" as president. For the record, no president is required to salute military personnel. And presidential salutes did not become commonplace until Reagan became president. But Eisenhower, a five-star U. S.  Army general, did salute ""military personnel"" as president, at least occasionally. Does that mean he did it all the time?Reagan perhaps made the practice routine, but Eisenhower did salute military personnel."
"Statement: If Wisconsins governor cuts perquisites as much as he plans to do, it would still leave (workers) better off than their private sector counterparts.
Speaker: george-will (columnist party)
Topic: labor,pundits,state-budget,abc-news-week

Analysis: The point is that it's important to consider an employee's total package of wages and benefits when comparing public and private sector compensation. But that's not the issue before us here. Will clearly stated that he was talking about just the benefits side of the equation. And with regard to the changes Walker has proposed -- requiring greater employee contributions to pension and health care -- Will is right that they would still leave public employees ""better off"" than those in the private sector."

Analysis: Rep.  John Garamendi said this week ""You cant get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun.

"Statement: 74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act.

Analysis: Edwards said that ""74 percent of Republicans support the Affordable Care Act. ""She actually has a reasonable point to make -- that, contrary to the popular impression of the law, most Republicans who have signed up for insurance through the law say they are satisfied with it. On the broader question of whether Republicans ""support the Affordable Care Act,"" the results in recent polls have ranged from 8 percent and 15 percent -- far lower than the 74 percent a viewer would be led to believe from watching Edwards during the roundtable segment."
"Statement: For every $1 spent on afterschool programs, we can save over $5, almost $6, in crime costs down the line.
Speaker: peter-kilmartin (democrat party)
Topic: crime,economy,education,poverty

Analysis: RIDE cited several studies in the report on afterschool and summer-learning programs. All were cited accurately and properly footnoted to enable readers to check the sources. ""Well, the one cited source we checked -- because it impressed Kilmartin -- turned out to be a study that RIDE misrepresented. Kilmartin was quoting a report he thought he could trust."
"Statement: The federal government has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills and wont default.
Speaker: roger-williams (republican party)
Topic: debt,federal-budget

Analysis: Williams said the government ""has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills"" and wont default. In the 12 months through September 2014, the government is projected to raise $3 trillion in revenue, far more than enough to cover some $237 billion in its projected interest costs. In this way, perhaps, default could be avoided. Still, Williams made a broader reference to paying ""our bills,"" and on that front, theres debate over whether the government could meet all its obligations or have the authority to pick and choose what to pay."
"Statement: Says Alex Sink failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices.
Speaker: republican-party-florida (republican party)
Topic: corporations

Analysis: The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having ""failed Florida homeowners by using predatory lending practices,"" citing the subprime lending practices of Bank of Americas NationsCredit and EquiCredit during her time as the banks Florida president. The EquiCredit problems were a nationwide issue, though, not just in the Sunshine State. And EquiCredit used brokers to sell their products, not Bank of America Florida employees. Sink would have had no control over that. The video also seems to imply Sink was somehow responsible for the precipitous loss in property values since 2008, but that timeline doesnt match up, either. There doesnt seem to be much of anything at all to tie Sink with EquiCredit, other than they both answered to Bank of America HQ in Charlotte."
"Statement: Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: financial-regulation

Analysis: Rubio said, ""Over 40 percent of small and mid-size banks that loan money to small businesses have been wiped out since Dodd-Frank has passed. ""Rubios figure is overstated for the time frame he gives. The highest estimate we found shows a 16 percent decline in the past five years -- less than half of what he said. The trend Rubio describes began decades before Dodd-Frank became law in 2010. Even then, experts say a host of factors other than Dodd-Frank are at play."

"Statement: Says that Starbucks took Christmas off of their brand new cups.
Speaker: joshua-feuerstein (republican party)
Topic: religion

Analysis: Feuerstein said Starbucks took ""Christ and Christmas"" off their cups. Feuersteins prank suggested he meant the word Christmas literally. Going back over 10 years, we could find no proof that the words Christ or Christmas have ever appeared on a Starbucks cup. If they werent there in the first place, you cant say the companyremoved them."
"Statement: Atmospheric conditions could push a footballs pressure down approximately one-and-a-half pounds per square inch.
Speaker: bill-belichick (none party)
Topic: sports

Analysis: Belichick said that moving the footballs from indoors to outdoors could explain the loss of about 1. 5 pounds per square inch of pressure. Experimental and mathematical results are in that ballpark. The ideal gas law predicted a 1 pound loss. The rain that day would explain at least another 0. 2 pound shift and possibly as much as 0. 7. Within the limits of what the physics alone can tell us at this point, the math gets us pretty close to what Belichick said."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding.
Speaker: ted-cruz (republican party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: Cruz said Clinton ""supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding. ""Clinton clearly supports a womans right to choose an abortion and shes called for ending congressional restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions. However, shes said since 2000 that shed support a legislated late-term limit on abortion if it included an exception to protect the health of the woman--which the law against partial-birth abortions does not. She hasn't pitched for unlimited abortion on demand."
"Statement: Under legislation that has cleared the Georgia House, some children who are legal refugees could obtain state scholarships to attend private schools.
Speaker: associated-press (none party)
Topic: autism,children,disability,education,families,immigration,state-budget,state-finances

Analysis: The children were placed in Georgia early in the year by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement as the Obama administration grappled with a surge of Central American children illegally crossing the southwest border. Our conclusion: Legislation has cleared the Georgia House that would expand the list of students eligible for a private school scholarship program created in 2007. The scholarships are now offered in varying amounts to students with disabilities. The bill would open the program to about 700 legal refugees who are not proficient in English."
"Statement: We went from losing 3 million jobs in the last six months of the Bush Administration, adding almost 600,000 private sector jobs in the first six months of the year.
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)
Topic: economy,government-efficiency,job-accomplishments

Analysis: By June 2010, the number was 107,700,000. That's a difference of 593,000 jobs -- ""almost 600,000"" in our book. In all, Biden's numbers understated the losses under Bush and overstated the losses under Obama, but both of these errors work against the administration's own interests. And in the third case, Biden's number easily qualifies as ""almost 600,000."
"Statement: The STAR Ohio fund just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive.
Speaker: josh-mandel (republican party)
Topic: economy,job-accomplishments,state-finances

Analysis: But the rating already had been in place for 16 years. It did not improve under Mandel, as a reasonable person might assume from his email. And while he gets some credit for maintaining the rating, his email overstated the case. Those are important details that add context."
"Statement: Taxpayers are on the hook ... for less than a third of the proposed new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and those funds are repaid from money that comes from outsiders.

"Statement: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,economy,jobs

Analysis: Obama is correct on the numbers. By mentioning his policies, he's making a modest linkage that they deserve credit for the improvement when economists say they are just one factor."
"Statement: Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: Perry said: ""Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State. ""That is, Missouri residents who moved to Texas through those years earned more the year before they moved than all income-tax-filing Texas residents who moved to Missouri in those years. Still, adjusted for inflation, the annual difference averages about $50 million--more than Perrys unadjusted figure. Then again, this did not hold for every year. In six years--most recently 2005--there was less than a $40 million difference."
"Statement: A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down.
Speaker: bill-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: debt,economy,education

Analysis: Former President Bill Clinton said at a recent campaign rally in Los Angeles: ""A college loan is the only loan in the United States that you cannot refinance when interest rates go down. ""Borrowers of federally backed student loans, which account for about 90 percent of student loans, cannot refinance those into lower-interest federal loans. Congress sets the interest rate on these loans, and theres no provision in federal law that allows for them to be refinanced. Depending on factors such as income, some borrowers can refinance their federal loans into lower-interest private loans, though they risk losing their federal loan protections. Clinton most likely was referring only to federally backed loans when he made his statement, but a clarification about private loans would have helped."
"Statement: The House of Representatives has never passed a resolution of disapproval to condemn a member's behavior.
Speaker: john-boehner (republican party)
Topic: history

Analysis: While there may be more such instances deep in congressional history - finding them would require reviewing reams of legislation introduced since the founding of Congress - the only example the historian's office could readily find was against Rep.  Bill Thomas, who, in 2003 as the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called in the U. S.  Capitol Police to remove Democratic panel members who were protesting Thomas' handling of a pension bill. The resolution was dropped by a vote of 170-143. In recent history, there's only been one instance of the chamber specifically using a resolution of disapproval to punish a lawmaker, though the historian's office said there may be more."
"Statement: We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Obama said, ""We are younger than our competitors, and this is entirely because of immigration. ""Brazil and India, which are best described as emerging but still developing competitors, have substantially younger populations. His main point  that immigration is driving Americas relative youth  is largely accurate. The United States is home to more immigrants than any other country, and many of them are younger and reproduce at higher rates than do native-born Americans."
"Statement: Recent international reports show the United States near the bottom among industrialized nations for k-12 academic achievement.
Speaker: chip-rogers (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: The most recent international reports that include developed nations show American students are in the bottom third in math, in the middle in science and in the upper third in reading. They show hes partially accurate."
"Statement: Says 24 million people in this country cant find a full-time job, 50 million cant see a doctor when theyre sick, 47 million people need government help to feed themselves and 15 million families owe more than the value of their home.
Speaker: alan-grayson (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: He says Depression-era down payments were higher in the 1930s, giving folks some cushion as the crisis set in. Our ruling    Grayson's defense of the Occupy Wall Street movement earned him praise from the left-wing blosophere and pundits for its pith. No pundit or official  in the movement's first month had quite articulated the protesters' qualms -- high unemployment, expensive health care, poverty and underwater mortgage payments -- as Grayson did in 20 seconds on Maher's show."
"Statement: The policy mistakes that ... the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration.
Speaker: julius-jones (activist party)
Topic: criminal-justice

Analysis: Jones said, ""The policy mistakes that (Hillary) and the Clintons made got us, in large degree, to the situation that we are in today with mass incarceration. ""While Hillary Clinton as first lady had no official role in voting for or signing the 1994 crime bill, she certainly championed some of its policies that are now partially blamed for the growth of the prison population, such as longer, tougher prison sentences. The crime bill was not the root cause of this growth, however, as Americas prison population had been expanding since the late 1980s."
"Statement: Says he raised average family income by 50 percent during his tenure as Arkansas governor.
Speaker: mike-huckabee (republican party)
Topic: income,state-budget

Analysis: Huckabee said he ""raised average family income by 50 percent"" during his tenure as Arkansas governor. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends."
"Statement: They tried to give us $400 million to build a high-speed train that goes 39 miles an hour.
Speaker: john-kasich (republican party)
Topic: infrastructure,stimulus,transportation

Analysis: Other states, meanwhile, have said theyd like Ohios share of rail money if Kasich doesnt want it. So Kasich is correct in that the federal government has approved $400 million in stimulus for development of high-speed rail service in Ohio. But his use of 39 mph as an average speed for the train relies on projections the administration discarded and ignores results of a newer study that included changes to the rail route. Thats an important detail; one thats needed to keep things in context."
"Statement: Says the CBO estimates that fully extending the Bush tax cuts would add 600,000-1.4 million jobs in 2011 and 900,000-2.7 million jobs in 2012.
Speaker: national-association-manufacturers (none party)
Topic: economy,taxes

Analysis: The more jobs we can create, the more economic growth we will see across the nation. ""But she didn't push back on the substance of our analysis. So NAM is accurately quoting the numbers on the Republican alternative but conveniently leaving out the detail that the Democratic alternative is nearly as good at creating jobs. It also ignores the CBO's conclusion that extending the tax breaks for upper-income Americans offers diminishing returns."
"Statement: President Reagan did it (raised the debt ceiling) 18 times. George W. Bush did it seven times.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: bipartisanship,federal-budget

Analysis: Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years ofvotes on the debt limitfrom the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support. Nonetheless, Obama is correct that raising the debt ceiling has been an issue repeatedly tackled by Republicans and Democrats alike. President Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times and George W.  Bush did it seven times."
"Statement: According to David Cay Johnston, the average American pays about 22 percent of their income to federal taxes. The richest 400 Americans pay about 16 percent of their income to federal taxes.
Speaker: chris-hayes (none party)
Topic: pundits,taxes

Analysis: Describing an individual filing singly as ""the average American,"" as Hayes did, means focusing on a type of filer with relatively high tax rates, compared to families. Just as the United States has ""people whose incomes are negative and some who make almost a million dollars a day,"" average Americans also include people who are married and have kids, and who in turn benefit from tax breaks that reduce what they owe. We understand that Hayes was relying on an expert tax journalist for his numbers and that the numbers as they were calculated are correct. But the calculation was based only on one of type filer, so we do think that its important to add context to his comment."

Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: economy,job-accomplishments,jobs

Analysis: Perry said: ""Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide. ""That conclusion is supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. This might be an imperfect way to explore this facet, but there also don't appear to be better approaches."
"Statement: Says two-thirds of groups targeted for IRS scrutiny were not conservative.
Speaker: progress-texas (none party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Progress Texas has twice said that two-thirds of the groups whose applications for tax-exempt status were scrutinized by the IRS were not conservative. The groups fraction appears to be an unsupported assumption tied to a government report saying that 96 of 298 IRS-scrutinized organizations, or about a third, had ""tea party,"" ""patriot"" or ""9/12"" in their names. The report listed other criteria the IRS used, some of which appeared to be aimed at conservatives. But the report has no information on the political makeup of the other groups, and we see no other indications that their political leanings have been authoritatively summed up or individually revealed, though the IRS has said the scrutinized groups without ""tea party"" in their names reflected ""all political views,"" which presumably would fold in liberals to moderates to conservatives."
"Statement: In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And thats where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin.

Analysis: We can see how White might've been confused. Media coverage of the board's action hasn't always been precise. White's final sentence  that Jefferson was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change  is a more accurate way to put it."
"Statement: As a U.S. senator with salary and perks, ‪#Bernie‬ is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year.
Speaker: dinesh-dsouza (none party)
Topic: income,taxes

Analysis: DSouza said, ""As a U. S.  senator with salary and perks, #Bernie is in the top 1 percent, but still paid only 13 percent in taxes last year. ""Sanders and his wife made $205,617 in 2014, which is at least $100,000 short of what they would need to make it into the top 1 percent of earners. And it would be near impossible for Sanders to make up the difference with Senate perks, given the stringent rules against gifts. That being said, Sanders household income likely lands him in the top 6 percent or higher of earners, so still significantly higher than the average American. About 13 percent of Sanders income went to federal taxes; its a little higher if we include state taxes. As far as we can tell, though, he paid what was expected of him under current law. DSouza far overstates Sanders earnings, and he makes unprovable accusations about perks that Sanders receives as a senator."
"Statement: You know we can't just pull out now... The truth of the matter is: If we started today, it would take one year, one year to get 160,000 troops physically out of Iraq, logistically.
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)
Topic: iraq

Analysis: U. S.  commanders say it would be a lengthy process, and independent military analysts have said it would take about a year to pull U. S.  troops out of Iraq safely. It could be done faster, but with larger U. S.  casualties and more abandoned equipment, experts say. McClatchy Newspapers has reported that a simulation conducted by the Pentagon since the debate suggested a retreat could take as little as six months, but critics said that estimate is overly optimistic. ""We must consider the complexity of the threat and deliberately reduce our forces based on the situation on the ground as well as the capability of the Iraqi security forces,"" Army Lt.  Gen.  Ray Odierno, the deputy commander of forces in Iraq, said at a briefing this month."
"Statement: From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction.

Analysis: Sanders said, ""From 2013-2015, the richest 14 Americans increased their net wealth by more than $157 billion, yet the Republican budget would not require these Americans to contribute one penny to deficit reduction. ""The 14 richest Americans net wealth did go up by about $157 billion between 2013 and 2015. The proposed Republican budget does not ask anything specific of the ultra-wealthy. It does not raise taxes, but it says it intends to streamline the tax code. However, these are broad strokes -- not specific legislation. So we dont know how lawmakers would specifically handle these proposals, and we dont know how they would impact the ultra-wealthy."

Analysis: If a cell phone directory is ever created, Katz said, it's likely to work differently: People would have to opt in to get their number listed. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers dont call consumers on their cell phones without their consent."

Analysis: So this number is also off -- apparently by a lot. The MPAs case would actually be stronger if they used a more accurate number, since during the previous 24 years the annual savings would ramp up until it reaches that projected $184 million in year in year 25."
"Statement: Clackamas County Commissioners approved a re-negotiated agreement to lower the countys contribution to TriMets Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail project to $19.9 million from $25 million.
Speaker: clackamas-county-commission (none party)
Topic: county-budget,county-government,debt,transportation

Analysis: The countys financial contribution to TriMet for the new Orange line is now $22. 6 million, much of which will be financed by borrowing. The in-kind contributions come from money the county will now forgo or must spend to meet its obligations."
"Statement: Says Texas has 11 different felonies you can commit with an oyster.
Speaker: scott-henson (none party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice,food-safety

Analysis: Henson said there are 11 Texas felonies one can commit with an oyster. He could have said 16, according to the states breakdown of felony offenses, though Parks & Wildlife suggests such oyster-related crimes break down to seven distinct offenses. Significantly, too, these felony charges are rare. No one can even face one without having previously been convicted of at least one related misdemeanor."
"Statement: The Obama administration is unwinding our nations welfare-to-work requirements.
Speaker: bob-mcdonnell (republican party)
Topic: welfare

Analysis: Our Ruling    McDonnell said the Obama administration is ""unwinding"" welfare-to-work requirements. But a new Obama program does not end welfare-to-work mandates. To the contrary, it strengthens the requirements by granting waivers to states seeking to make the work requirements more successful. The waivers would be granted to pilot programs that are individually evaluated; HHS is not proposing a blanket national change to welfare law."
"Statement: Electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1.
Speaker: don-francis (none party)
Topic: state-budget,taxes,transportation

Analysis: That statement is backed up by data available so far on new car registrations and new car sales. Keep in mind that car sales spiked as people rushed to buy before the credit expired July 1, and that makes the post-July 1 drop in sales look that much more shocking. Whether that trend holds remains to be seen. But everything we found so far indicates Francis is on the money."
"Statement: The Redskins Training Camp deal generated $40 million in new private investment in the city.
Speaker: dwight-jones (democrat party)
Topic: city-government,job-accomplishments

Analysis: Jones said the three-part development deal that brought the Redskins training camp to Richmond ""generated $40 million in new private investment in the city. ""The mayor offered a solid estimate of the total construction costs. But he spoke in past tense, as if the money already has been spent. For the most part, it hasnt. No start dates have been established for two of the projects totaling $32. 5 million: Bon Secours expansion of Richmond Community Hospital and its redevelopment of Westhampton School. Important contractual conditions first must be fulfilled. The Redskins training facility, which opened last summer, was built with $10 million of city money. Richmond, at the end of March, will have recovered $1. 82 million of that money through the sale of naming rights and the leasing of office space at the facility to Bon Secours. That number could grow to as much as $6. 3 million over the next five years. No doubt, the three projects have the potential to generate $40 million in private investment. But the mayor is counting the checks before theyve been written."
"Statement: The GOP budget plan would cut nearly a million jobs.
Speaker: organizing-america (democrat party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,jobs

Analysis: And Republicans have brought forward a number of economists who say spending reductions would increase employment. Democrats -- and the economists they cite -- may be right when they say the GOPs proposed cuts would cost large numbers of jobs. But they are basing their reports on economic projections, not guarantees. Just as we said when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor declared lower spending would create more private sector jobs, no one knows for sure."
"Statement: There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of the country.
Speaker: rick-santorum (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Santorum said, ""There are more people living in this country who were not born here than at anytime in the history of country. ""In terms of the absolute number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States, Santorum is correct. However, in terms of the number of immigrants as a percentage of the total population, hes not. Immigrants made up a bigger share of the total population from 1860 to 1920 than they do today. This measurement is by far the more useful of the two, experts said, as it accounts for total population growth. Whether its even worthwhile to compare immigration levels of today with other points in U. S.  history is up for debate given drastic economic and political shifts over time."
"Statement: Says Hillary Clinton defended Syrias President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that countrys civil war.

Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: Criticizing parts of Clintons tenure as secretary of state, Wallace said Clinton ""defended Syrias President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that countrys civil war. ""Clintons original comments in March 2011 were not that straightforward. The statement in question was actually, ""Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. ""Clinton was talking about the beliefs of Congress and didnt ""defend"" Assad, as Wallace put it, instead saying that the use of force that he deployed was more ""than any of us would want to see. ""Wallaces statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context."

Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: The postal unions' ad blames financial problems on ""a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue, while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts. ""The ad is right that the law did require payments of approximately that amount and that those payments have had a significant effect on the post office's bottom line. The additional overpayments are subject to debate. Even so, the law is hardly the only challenge the post office faces; it's also facing continuing declines in first-class mail."
"Statement: As many as six federal department budget bills have been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops.
Speaker: lloyd-doggett (democrat party)
Topic: congress,federal-budget,history

Analysis: Doggett said in San Antonio that House votes on up to six federal department budget bills had been delayed because of opposition to amendments that would ban Confederate battle flag sales at federal building gift shops. When he spoke, the House had yet to vote on six 2016 spending measures. During floor debate, a stand-off about Democratic amendments restricting displays and sales of the Confederate flag--including a proposal barring the park service from enlisting concessionaires selling the flags--evidently derailed the Interior appropriations act with expected House action on two other spending acts reportedly put off. Still, other factorssuch as general reluctance among House leaders to send spending proposals to the potentially unfriendly Senatemay figure into the bodys inaction on the six measures."
"Statement: Shes voted for 60 tax increases, hurting the middle class and small businesses.

"Statement: Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan.

"Statement: A 2013 state law would allow the operator of an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin to fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste.
Speaker: dan-kaufman (none party)
Topic: environment

Analysis: Our rating The state law aimed at paving the way for the Gogebic mine relaxed environmental regulations for iron mining, and sped up the permit process, steps aimed at giving the company more certainty. Kaufman says that law also lets the company ""fill in pristine streams and ponds with mine waste. ""Kaufmans correct that the new mining law allows streams and ponds to be filled in at the mining site. But he left out an important point -- that before that takes place the company and state would have to strike a deal for comparable streams and ponds to be created elsewhere."
"Statement: America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Our rating Trump called the United States ""one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. ""Trump tweaked his language this time in effort to improve his accuracy, saying its ""one of"" the highest taxed nations. However, he didnt specify that distinction, and a reasonable listener could take away from Trumps remark that he meant taxes overall, particularly given that he set up the line with a joint reference to middle-income Americans and businesses."
"Statement: If black America were a country, itd be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world.
Speaker: larry-elder (talk-show-host party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,economy,poverty

Analysis: Arguing that racism is ""not a major problem,"" Elder said that ""if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest in the world. ""Elder took an estimate of African-Americans'total earned income ($836 billion in 2011) and looked at how it compared to national GDPs (it was actually 16th). But comparing earned income for a group of people to national GDPs isnt a sound methodology, experts told us. The comparison falls more off the rails when you look at things on a per capita basis. In that scenario, black Americas buying power would rank around 44th when compared to countries per capita GDPs. Correction: Elder said racism was not a ""major"" problem."
"Statement: Since Republicans took over after the 2010 election, the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent.
Speaker: dale-kooyenga (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Likewise, there was a small increase between those years, following the trend. Our rating Kooyenga said graduation rates in the state increased thanks to actions by Republicans, including the passage of Act 10. The numbers did rise, but the trend existed before the GOP took over. Whats more, experts say many other factors are at work and the passage of Act 10 wasnt followed by significant changes."
"Statement: It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows.
Speaker: terry-mcauliffe (democrat party)

Analysis: McAuliffe said, ""It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows. ""His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they ""dont know"" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published. McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely."
"Statement: 2008 was the deadliest year of the war (in Afghanistan) for American forces.

Topic: education,new-hampshire-2012

Analysis: Our ruling  The Democrats say Texas's ranking for high school graduates fell four spots under Perry. They are largely right about the drop, though their numbers are slightly off. The Democrats also exaggerate by blaming Perry. Although experts say he shares some responsibility, it is largely a factor of the state's demographics and history of education funding ."

Speaker: jim-steineke (republican party)

Analysis: His Twitter followers may not be following the project closely, but Steineke certainly knows Barrett isnt planning a nostalgic system with old-time or refurbished cars. In theory, its a catalyst rather than a throwback. And at least some other cities see streetcars in the same light."
"Statement: Americans, in the last 30 years, have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education) and the results have gotten worse, not better.
Speaker: michelle-rhee (none party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Duringher trip to Florida, Rhee said that Americans, in the last 30 years, ""have more than doubled the amount of money we are spending per child (on education)  and the results have gotten worse, not better. ""Per-pupil education spending has grown significantly over the past 30 years, and the United States spends among the most to educate its K-12 students. But to say that student results have gotten worse is simplifying things a bit. Maybe the return for the increased spending isn't what people want, but student performance in math and reading has improved slightly over the past 30 years, according to statistics kept by the U. S.  Department of Education. Different assessments essentially show that U. S.  students have failed to make the gains that other countries have. But they haven't showed U. S.  students performing worse."

"Statement: Says Congressman Bill Pascrell voted to remove the public option from the Affordable Health Care Act.
Speaker: steve-rothman (democrat party)

"Statement: Lawmakers were paid for their off-season efforts to, for the first time, take the lead in drawing borders for two would-be cities.
Speaker: mary-margaret-oliver (democrat party)
Topic: state-finances

Analysis: Once the governor signs the bills, about 100,000 people will decide this fall on whether to form one or both cities. The debate about those boundaries nearly killed those votes for the second year in a row. Oliver said that taxpayers paid for lawmakers to work out a deal for both sides."

"Statement: Under a proposed medical marijuana amendment in Florida, you dont get refills -- you get it forever.
Speaker: drug-free-america (none party)
Topic: florida-amendments,health-care,marijuana

Analysis: Miguel said when it comes to doctors recommendations for medical marijuana, ""You don't get refills, you get it forever. ""He was referring to how a doctors ""recommendation"" for cannabis does not allow the same level of control as a medical prescription does. He said there was no written limitation on how much or for how long a patient could get marijuana in the amendment, a common criticism by opponents of the amendment. Its possible that potential Florida regulations would not limit time on a registry or how long a doctors certification would last for a patient. But it would be premature, and speculative, to assume that there would be no way under the amendment to stop a recommendation from going on forever. Other states have created their own rules, limiting the quantity and frequency of the drug that patients can get. They also limit how long patients can be on a registry before requiring a doctors approval."
"Statement: A data-storing microchip ""would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option.""
Speaker: chain-email (none party)

Analysis: As the final House version (H. R. 3962) approached a vote by the full chamber, the term ""implantable"" was removed from that section. It's not clear why the change was made, but the chain e-mail now has even less credibility than it did before (if that's possible)."
"Statement: Enacting the Right-to-Carry Act would amount to expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.
Speaker: david-cicilline (democrat party)
Topic: crime,guns,legal-issues,public-safety

Analysis: Cicilline said the Right-to-Carry bill would expand rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines. But we found that his statement didnt meet the test on the fourth. To apply the ""terrorist"" label to all 400,000 people on the governments watchlist, or to those convicted of a misdemeanor ""terroristic"" threat, is, at best, an exaggeration. Further, by saying the Republicans ""chose to focus their efforts"" on expanding the gun rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers,"" he implied, with a heavy dose of hyperbole, that this was their intent.

"Statement: Says the treasurers office has saved $37 million in management costs for the oversight of public investments.
Speaker: ted-wheeler (democrat party)
Topic: government-efficiency

Analysis: A third-party report showed that Oregon paid $39 million less in fees than its peers. But just because a peer group spent more than Oregon doesnt mean Oregon was ever at risk of spending that much. Moreover, a key reason for our lower-than-peer-average fees is that our private investments are older, a crop of decisions that have nothing to do with Wheeler. These are critical facts that would give a different impression of the savings statement."
"Statement: Says Georgia will send more state money per child to state charter schools and that budget cuts are not applied to those charter schools.
Speaker: herb-garrett (none party)
Topic: education

Analysis: However, traditional schools will get local money that state-approved charter schools do not. In 2011, the state Supreme Court ruled state lawmakers do not have the power to grant the state authority to approve and fund charter schools over the objection of local school boards. In conclusion, Garrett was correct on his larger point that state-approved charter schools will get more money per pupil under the proposed amendment than traditional public schools."
"Statement: Jorge Elorza wants to impose a municipal income tax.

Analysis: Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci said Jorge Elorza ""wants to impose a municipal income tax. ""Elorza has said he favors the tax in the context of using it to replace other taxes that he regards as less fair. But he has also made it clear that raising taxes in the city is not an option and has said it would not be part of his agenda."
"Statement: The Supreme Court cant overrule the other two branchesof government.
Speaker: mike-huckabee (republican party)
Topic: history,supreme-court

Analysis: In trying to make the point that the judicial branch has grabbed too much power,Huckabee said the Supreme Court ""cant overrule the other two"" branchesof government. But theSupreme Court indeed has the power to overrule the other branches through judicial review -- the court's ability to rule that a law passed by Congress and signed by the president is unconstitutional. While there are certainly tools the president and Congress can use to go around a Supreme Court decision it doesn't like -- such as amending the Constitution or selecting justices that support the alternate position -- these are difficult to accomplish and usually require years of effort, making them rare. The much more common result is for the executive and legislative branches accept a Supreme Court decision as the final word."

"Statement: As governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and fees almost 100 times, saving the taxpayers almost $380-million. I left a surplus of nearly $850-million.
Speaker: mike-huckabee (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: The Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration estimated that tax revenues grew by $505-million between 1997 and 2005. As governor, Huckabee supported a number of tax increases, including hikes in the state sales tax, a cigarette and tobacco tax and a nursing home bed tax, to name just a few. The per capita tax burden in state and local taxes rose in Arkansas by 47 percent between 1997 and 2005. Huckabee correctly toots his own horn about a major tax cut in his second year as governor and he did leave a big surplus when he left office."
"Statement: I havent raised taxes in the time Ive been the governor of New Jersey.

"Statement: We are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history (of the United States.)
Speaker: rick-santorum (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Santorum said, ""we are accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have in the history"" of the country. Over the last 10 years, in raw numbers,the United States has admitted slightly more immigrants into the country compared to any other 10-year period. But when you factor in the new arrivals as a share of the U. S.  population, 1905-14is the leading time period. And when looking just at raw numbers, the United States admitted more immigrants in 1907, 1990 and 1991. In fact, the 2013 tally -- 990,553 -- would rank 20th all time."
"Statement: Congress is bewildered at the scope and reach of our spying apparatus but in 2008 and 2012 explicitly rejected an amendment calling for more disclosure.
Speaker: jon-stewart (none party)
Topic: foreign-policy,pundits,terrorism

Analysis: Stewart said Congress had given intelligence agencies broad powers to engage in surveillance and had rejected an amendment that would have required more disclosure. Overall, changes made in 2008 and continued in 2012 did give U. S.  spy agencies more leeway. Individual lawmakers offered amendments aimed expressly at giving Congress more details on intelligence activities, but they failed to win enough support."
"Statement: Six people in Florida die as a result of (not expanding Medicaid) every day.
Speaker: charlie-crist (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,medicaid,poverty

Analysis: Crist said that Floridas decision not to expand Medicaid means that ""six people in Florida die as a result of that every day. ""The statistic is based on a recent study, but experts note a few caveats. First, Crist used the studys high-end figure; using the low-end figure cuts the number of deaths to three a day. Second, experts caution about uncertainties about the studies upon which the new study was based. And third, while many experts agree that its plausible to assume that the lack of Medicaid coverage could lead to deaths, they were careful to add that it is difficult to pinpoint a number as precise as the one Crist offered."
"Statement: Gov. Maggie Hassans budget proposal raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million.
Speaker: americans-prosperity (none party)
Topic: state-budget,taxes

Analysis: The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity says that Gov. Maggie Hassans budget proposal ""raises taxes on small businesses and increases taxes and fees by $100 million. ""Hassan indeed proposes changes that would result in more tax money being paid by businesses in the state. Yes, some small businesses would receive a tax break under the governors compromise plan, but the other changes still apply. And looking at a list of tax and fee changes the governor put together in February -- including the tweaks to the tax code -- easily adds up to $100 million. Overall, we find the statement to be accurate, but it could use additional clarification and documentation."
"Statement: Only in Washington would politicians spend $27 million to teach Moroccans how to make pottery.
Speaker: karen-handel (republican party)

Analysis: But a closer look at the facts shows that the $27 million was for an entire economic development program in Morocco, of which the pottery training was only a fraction of the cost -- about 8 percent of the total program. Her overall point that the program was a failure is supported by an inspector generals audit that found that the pottery training was mismanaged, poorly organized and ineffective."
"Statement: Hillary Clinton ""starts off with 47 percent of the country against her.""

Analysis: Obama's unfavorable ratings tend to be well under 40 percent. In several polls, his unfavorable ratings are in the 20s. Not every poll rates her unfavorables consistently as high as 47 percent, and poll numbers are always a little bit squishy. But, the     USA Today    /Gallup Poll has polled often on Clinton's unfavorables, and the average of 21 polls puts her negatives at 47 percent."
"Statement: SaysRand Paulhas put out budgets to cut the military in half.
Speaker: adam-kinzinger (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,military

Analysis: In 2011, Paul released a budget proposal that reduced annual defense spending quite significantly, but not anywhere near 50 percent. There are different ways to measure the reductions, but theyre in the range of 25 to 30 percent. Paul later unveiled another budget that actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. Both Paul budgets also eliminated funding in the defense budget for war spending and overseas operations based on the assumption that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were winding down. Lawmakers can argue whether that was prudent, however, its important context."
"Statement: Groups that receive foreign money are spending huge sums to influence American elections.

"Statement: Says legislative cuts mean Texas is spending on average $500 less per student.
Speaker: donna-howard (democrat party)
Topic: education,state-budget

Analysis: Howards statement is about the effect of two major legislative actions on public school funding. By every measure we found and one that we ginned up, those actions resulted in a per-student funding reduction of at least $500. We think its significant that those figures represent averages  a fact that Howard noted in her rally remarks. That means some districts were likely to be hit harder, others less hard, especially by the legislated cuts to grants, which are not distributed uniformly to districts."
"Statement: [A]t his current rate, President Obama will have added more debt to the United State of America by the end of his first term than each of the previous 43 presidents -- combined!
Speaker: GaGOP (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: There are other factors to consider, however, when examining the accuracy of this statement, such as measuring the debt increase by the nations gross domestic product. As for whether Obama bears all of the blame here, Congress, which has a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, passed the 2011 debt deal and is partly responsible for the projected increase by fiscal year 2013."
"Statement: We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida.
Speaker: bob-graham (democrat party)
Topic: terrorism

Analysis: Graham said, ""We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida. ""Al-Qaida was started in an effort, largely backed by Saudi Arabia, to force the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. The government did not, strictly speaking, create the organization. It was the product of jihadists wanting to continue the fight after the Soviets left, using the funds of Saudi backers to do it. It prospered because of donations from Saudi interests, including groups tied to the government. The Saudis deserve significant responsibility for its existence. But Graham's phrasing could leave people believing the Saudi government itself created the terrorist organization."
"Statement: Says Williamson County Attorney Jana Duty has never prosecuted a single adult felony case.
Speaker: john-bradley (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: Duty points out that her office prosecutes adult misdemeanors and juvenile felonies, though it appears that none made it to trial in recent years. Hers may be a reasonable point. Still, Bradley specified that Duty had not conducted adult felony prosecutions."
"Statement: The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!
Speaker: glenn-grothman (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance,elections

Analysis: Perhaps he should, but the candidates statement was about fundraising. Our rating Grothman boasted that, ""The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched! ""But the numbers show that Leibham matched or out-did Grothman on most measures. That reads as pretty matched to us."
"Statement: Issue 2 makes it illegal for us to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job.
Speaker: we-are-ohio (none party)
Topic: elections,labor

Analysis: We think the natural reading of ""enough firefighters to do the job"" is how many would be needed to fight a fire -- or on duty. Scenes in We Are Ohios ad show firefighters responding to a call, buttressing that notion. There is language in SB 5 that could allow negotiations on overall staffing levels -- a point of clarification -- but only if management allows the topic to be part of negotiations. And there is a clear prohibition against negotiating the number of workers ""on duty."
"Statement: Says although the unemployment rate seems to be improving, it does not reflect real job creation -- its caused by a shrinking of the actual labor force.
Speaker: arianna-huffington (none party)
Topic: economy,jobs,pundits,abc-news-week

Analysis: According to the minutes of the meeting, ""several participants noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable more to people withdrawing from the labor force and to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring. """"There has been some growth in employment, but not as much as the headline-figure drop in the unemployment rate would initially suggest, and labor-force participation has dropped during the recession,"" said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""There are caveats you could add to make the statement more complete, but as a one-sentence summary it is not far off the mark. ""Ultimately, we agree that Huffington is largely correct that the unemployment rate is affected by people leaving the workforce, not just by job creation, even if she has slightly exaggerated its extent."
"Statement: Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.

Analysis: Walker has promised that cuts will be made in public employee benefits and suggested the state could reduce union bargaining rights. It may have been a bit of satirical venting, but not everyone got the joke."
"Statement: Obama voted ""to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield.""
Speaker: joe-lieberman (independent party)

Analysis: Our rating Erpenbach said: ""In general, it appears"" Wisconsins right to work bill would ""likely apply to"" the Green Bay Packers players and their union.

"Statement: The so-called defense minister of the Peoples Republic of Donetsk ... actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media.
Speaker: john-kerry (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy,military

Analysis: Kerry said, ""(Strelkov) posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media. ""We know that a post appeared on Strelkovs social media profile bragging about shooting down a transport plane close to the MH 17 crash site. In a subsequent post, Strelkov said the information passed along came not from him directly, but from militia members on the scene. Its impossible to know with certainty Strelkov's role in the post, or when the post was pulled, but we do know that the posts come from within the separatist movement -- as Strelkov himself said."
"Statement: Democrats are kind of falling over each other seeing who can raise taxes faster. It looks like they're going to raise taxes anywhere between 20 to 30 percent.
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: There are two problems with this. First of all, the Democrats aren't advocating the elimination of     all    of the 2001 tax cuts. And second, the logic of the Giuliani argument is that a rise in revenues is the same as a tax increase. If that's the standard, than President Bush's own budget for 2008, released in February, includes a 29 percent tax increase over the same period, too."
"Statement: Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality. Weve added jobs that mostly fall within the restaurant and bar sector industry. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U.S. Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs.
Speaker: lou-greenwald (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs,labor

Analysis: Greenwald said, ""Right now one of our highest job growth sectors is Leisure and Hospitality. These are not high-paying jobs, as the U. S.  Department of Labor estimates this is an industry sector with the lowest average wages and the lowest proportion of its workforce earning minimum or subminimum wage jobs. ""Leisure and Hospitality saw the second-highest rate of job growth in New Jersey in 2011, but a BLS economist confirmed that the average weekly salary of workers for that sector is the lowest among all sectors tracked. Greenwald, however, misstated that those jobs have the lowest proportion of workers earning minimum wage or below."
"Statement: Gov. Scott Walker bought 80 new, brand-new vehicles for the state that we probably dont need.
Speaker: kathleen-vinehout (democrat party)
Topic: government-efficiency,state-budget,state-finances,transportation

Analysis: Our rating Vinehout said Walker bought ""80 new, brand-new vehicles"" for the state that ""we probably dont need. ""Walker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly 80 more vehicles. But he hasnt bought any yet and, despite Vinehouts characterization of the purchases being an unnecessary expense, they are aimed at saving money."
"Statement: Says he passed eight measures, including ones to prevent groping at airport security checks and to bar sanctuary cities in Texas.
Speaker: david-dewhurst (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,homeland-security,immigration,legal-issues,transportation

Analysis: In his speech, Dewhurst listed the unsuccessful sanctuary and anti-groping proposals with other proposals, saying he ""passed"" each of them -- a characterization leaving the impression that every one of them became a statute. That's correct for six of them."
"Statement: Its gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker.
Speaker: john-boehner (republican party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,government-efficiency

Analysis: We found federal ""computer specialists"" made $88,920, compared to $78,010 for their private-sector counterparts. So where does that leave us?Using the Bureau of Labors data, the gap is a little wider, but the average federal worker pay still is considerably short of double."
"Statement: These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans.
Speaker: michele-bachmann (republican party)
Topic: health-care,new-hampshire-2012,abc-news-week

Analysis: Bachmann said, ""There's a board called IPAB. It's made up of 15 political appointees. These 15 political appointees will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans. ""There is a board with 15 members, and most are appointed through a political process, though they must have expertise in health care. But the board is intended to recommend cost savings for the Medicare program. It would not ""make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans."
"Statement: Says stores will be barred from selling 100-watt light bulbs as of 2012.
Speaker: michael-burgess (republican party)
Topic: energy

Analysis: Philips Electronics EcoVantage bulb is a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100-watt bulb. Two other industry players, Osram Sylvania and GE, have developed halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the efficiency standards. Upshot: As of January, traditional incandescent 100-watt bulbs wont be made, though stores can continue to sell existing stocks. Also, more efficient bulbs generating the same level of light will be available; they already are."
"Statement: Before our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected.

Topic: elections,history

Analysis: Scarborough said that before ""our last three presidents, you have to go back to the 1800s, early 1800s to find three presidents in a row being consecutively re-elected. ""The last -- and only -- presidents before Clinton, George W.  Bush and Obama to be re-elected back-to-back were Jefferson, Madison and Monroe in the early 1800s."
"Statement: Jason Carter supports using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare
Speaker: republican-governors-association (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Mischaracterizing his stance isnt hard to do when he wont give clear answers to the policy questions on voters minds. In summary, though, it is still a stretch to conclude that Carters objection to one anti-Obamacare bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law. But because Carters stance has been so fuzzy, it opens the door for interpretation about what he really believes."
"Statement: The most recent Associated Press poll has Nader-Gonzalez at 6 percent, without any national coverage, against McCain and Obama.
Speaker: ralph-nader (independent party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Obama and McCain had been mentioned on television about that much in just the previous three days. Nader's coverage had been so slight compared to that of the major-party candidates that we have a hard time holding his hyperbole against him."
"Statement: Dan Patrick said that if women get paid less than a man for the same job, that thats not a problem.
Speaker: leticia-van-de-putte (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,women

Analysis: Van de Putte said Patrick said that if women ""get paid less than a man for the same job, that thats not a problem. ""Broadly, both candidates were vague in their use of ""problem,"" leaving room for interpretation. Still, Patrick answered a question by saying he doesnt think the equal-pay issue is a problem and he hammered his opposition to any state law mandating equal pay. However, Patrick also said some businesses dont treat people fairly and said any worker should be paid on performance. These are important missing details."
"Statement: Weve got an average of 5,600 soldiers committing suicide. Thats about 20 a day.
Speaker: david-scott (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,veterans

Analysis: To sum it up, though Scott is a little off on his math, hes close enough on the daily rates for us. He has a point to drive home, that a lot of veterans are dying by their own hands. The problem is when he attempts to link the daily suicide rates of all military veterans, who may never have visited a VA center, with the current scandal."
"Statement: There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, If you give us more money we dont know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.
Speaker: craig-melvin (journalist party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Melvin said, ""There have even been Republican congressmen who have said, If you give us more money we don't know where we would even put additional Border Patrol agents.  "" Melvin got his information from an interview he conducted with a Democratic congressman who quoted two Texas Republicans as saying as much. But there is no public record of the two Texas Republicans, Reps.  Carter and Johnson, saying remarks along those lines that we could find. What we do know is that both Texas congressmen have more recently advocated for additional border patrol agents, a fact that neither Yarmuth or Melvin mentioned. For Melvin, he accurately recounted what he heard. But in this game of telephone, all we get is a busy signal at the other end."
"Statement: Today, for the first time in fifteen years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,trade

Analysis: We are also investing in training and working with area technical colleges and universities to find and equip skilled workers. ""Our conclusion    Obama singled out Master Lock saying the company brought back outsourced jobs and is operating at capacity for the first time in 15 years. Thats the same thing Master Lock executives said more than a year ago, and theyve continued to add jobs and said they would continue to do so. It also tracks with their efforts to attract a more highly skilled work force to run an updated operation."
"Statement: Tom Reed has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form.
Speaker: john-plumb (democrat party)
Topic: jobs,trade

Analysis: In an interview, Plumb said Reed ""has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form. ""Congress has voted on three trade agreements with other nations since Reed took office in 2011, and a look at the roll calls confirmed he voted for each one. Reed did vote to reauthorize the Export-Import bank. But Plumb got it right when he said the congressman voted for the trade agreements."
"Statement: ISIS camp a few miles from Texas, Mexican authorities confirm.
Speaker: judicial-watch (organization party)

Analysis: Judicial Watch said it confirmed ISIS has a camp in Mexico a few miles from El Paso. U. S. , Mexico and Texas officials told us they had no information to validate or corroborate this bombshell."
"Statement: New federal projections estimate that the health care overhaul will cost $1.76 trillion over 10 years -- well above the $940 billion Democrats originally claimed.
Speaker: tom-price (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: The 2012 report revised it downward to $768 billion. When you do the math correctly, the gross cost projection increased by less than 9 percent. The net cost estimate has actually dropped."

"Statement: The unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,economy,jobs

Analysis: Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16. 4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trumps 42 percent. CORRECTION, Feb.  11, 2016:We've updated this story to reflect some changes to the statistics for students listed in the table. Our new calculation puts the highest ""unemployment"" rate we could produce at 16. 4 percent."
"Statement: Common Core is not from the federal government, they do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all.
Speaker: sondy-pope (democrat party)

Analysis: Our rating Pope said: Common Core ""is not from the federal government,"" they ""do not have their fingerprints on this thing at all. ""Federal officials did not initiate the state standards for public schools or force them on the states. But they have given states financial incentives to adopt the standards."
"Statement: Social Security is indeed a Ponzi scheme.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: social-security

Analysis: In a Ponzi, investors have no clue where their money is going and are told lies by the promoters. Their analysis zeroed in on the lack of an element of deceit to how the 75-year-old Social Security program takes in money and pays it out. We'd add that Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people while a Ponzi scheme is a crime."
"Statement: Says Scott Walker brags a lot about having an independent agency investigate police shootings. Of course, he didnt fund it.
Speaker: gwen-moore (democrat party)
Topic: city-government,civil-rights,criminal-justice,public-safety,state-budget

Analysis: Walker has cited the fact that a law he signed was the first in the country to require independent investigations of deaths that involve police officers. And he did not include in his 2015-17 budget proposal funds requested by the state Department of Justice for five positions to implement the law. However, three months later in the budget process, Walker signed a final budget that included money for four positions, which had been added to the spending plan by state lawmakers. So, ultimately, Walker did include some funding, although only after the Legislature included it in its version of the budget."
"Statement: What the Arizona law does is make a state crime out of something that already is... a federal crime.
Speaker: george-will (columnist party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: He said that the the new Arizona immigration law makes what is already a federal crime into a state crime. And when it comes to some of the most talked about parts of the law, having to do with aliens who fail to carryproper paperwork andfailing to register, Will is correct about the core of the law; federal statutes already makes those two provisions a crime. But the law alsoincludes a new prohibition barring picking up day laborers on the street for hire and soliciting for work. That's not in the federal code."
"Statement: When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today: Yeah, were open.

"Statement: In Miami-Dade County, we spend at our school system over $20 million every year educating recent immigrants.
Speaker: carlos-curbelo (republican party)
Topic: education,immigration

Analysis: When talking on Fox News about the challenges posed by immigration, Curbelo said ""I'll give you an example, in our hometown, Miami Dade County. We spend at our school system over $20 million every year as a direct result of the broken immigration system. ""The more than $20 million a year figure is valid; it reflects annual costs for new students who need English for Speakers of Other Languages, or ESOL. The district spends additional money for existing students who need ESOL classes. Curbelo's comments also gloss over some of the complexity of immigration costs. We found differing opinion among experts as to what impact the law would have on school districts. Some said the costs would likely stay the same, other said costs would go up."
"Statement: The omnibus bill has only $3.8 billion in earmarks.
Speaker: democratic-congressional-leadership (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: ""Its easier to make your weight loss goals if you dont count your rear end,"" he said. Brost says she has been precise with reporters that she was referring to the ""non-project-based"" numbers. But judging from the number of times we found the number cited as the Democratic estimate for earmarks, her nuance was not caught by reporters or by Democrats who have cited the figure. Either way, the number is not a fair account of the total earmarks."
"Statement: Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history.
Speaker: jeb-bush (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,taxes

Analysis: Bush said, ""Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in Americanhistory. ""Yes, in 1999, Trump proposed a historically large one-time tax increase. Trump said the tax would have raised $5. 7 trillion and wiped out the national debt. It would have applied only to the wealthiest Americans."
"Statement: Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18-billion of our budget.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Another report found that appropriations bills in fiscal year 2008 included $16. 5 billion for earmarks. Those numbers are lower than previous years because earmarking dropped considerably following the congressional lobbying scandals of 2005 and 2006. But even at their peak in 2005, when earmarks hit $52-billion, according to the Congressional Research Service and the OMB, that was only 16 percent of that years deficit of $318-billion. The numbers show Obama gets his earmark number correct."
"Statement: Kim Myers voted repeatedly to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters.
Speaker: claudia-tenney (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Claudia Tenney said in July that Kim Myers voted ""to raise taxes on the people of Broome County, but made millions off of tax savings when her family business relocated its headquarters and jobs to Pennsylvania. ""She also voted to increase property taxes while president of the Vestal School Board."
"Statement: Californias Prop 60, which would requirecondom usein adult films, would put workers in the adult film industry at riskfor lawsuits and harassment.
Speaker: no-60-campaign-against-condom-requirement-adult-fi (organization party)
Topic: government-regulation,public-health

Analysis: The statement is partially accurate: Some adult film workers, and perhaps a growing share, could face lawsuits if they have a financial interest in the content they work on. But Prop 60 does not specify what constitutes a financial interest. Ultimately, it may be up to the courts to decide. Those who are independent contractors would face no legal action. The statement leaves out this key context and gives the impression that any or all workers could face lawsuits."
"Statement: We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge.
Speaker: loretta-weinberg (democrat party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: Weinberg said recently about the George Washington Bridge, ""We pay among the highest tolls in the nation for the privilege of crossing that bridge. ""The highest bridge toll in the region belongs to the MTA-operated Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, at $15, but the George Washington span and three others are close behind, at $13. Major toll bridges elsewhere in the country arent even close, save for the 17-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, whose $13 toll will jump to $15 on Jan.  1. Experts we spoke with cite varying factors for why the George Washington Bridges toll costs what it does, but the bottom line is that Weinbergs assessment about where the cost ranks nationwide is accurate."
"Statement: Sens. Isaksons, Chambliss Votes Against Unemployment Insurance Were Votes to Kill Nearly 6,000 Georgia Jobs.
Speaker: americans-united-change (none party)
Topic: federal-budget,jobs

Analysis: Other nationwide estimates suggest the jobs number in the report is on target. But it is still an estimate thats based on economic projections. And the overreaching point by American United for Change neglects the fact that Isakson and Chambliss back a GOP plan that would also extend jobless benefits."
"Statement: Says real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare.
Speaker: todd-hunter (republican party)
Topic: health-care,taxes

Analysis: Hunter said real estate taxes were put in place to pay for Obamacare. Thats an incomplete characterization, potentially leaving the misimpression well all be ponying up every time we sell a property. In reality, the tax helping to fund the health care law is an investment tax solely affecting the very wealthiest taxpayers and then only touched off by super-sized profits from any of a variety of investment types."
"Statement: Says today unemployment has been running near 12 percent or more for the last four years and the Legislature hasnt done much to lower it.
Speaker: tim-knopp (republican party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: We think the same way here. Knopp appears to be as responsible for a 6 percent unemployment figure as Telfer is for a 12 percent unemployment rate, and thats not very much. His figures are correct, making the statement partially accurate, but theres important information missing: The context of a global recession."
"Statement: Says Kay Bailey Hutchison voted for sanctuary cities.

"Statement: John Mica voted to borrow $10 trillion.
Speaker: sandy-adams (republican party)
Topic: debt,federal-budget,message-machine-2012,voting-record

Analysis: Adams said Mica ""voted to borrow $10 trillion. ""What she meant, her spokeswoman says, is the debt has increased by $10 trillion since he took office, an increase made possible by his sporadic votes to allow growth of the debt ceiling. We found his votes on the debt ceiling don't really tell the whole story. More importantly, we think, is the fact that he voted for some of the policies that caused the need for debt ceiling votes in the first place. Still, it takes more than one member of Congress to drive the debt up by the trillions."
"Statement: Says opponent Mary Burke told reporters she would have required workers to give up bargained-for healthcare and retirement benefits like Gov. Walker.
Speaker: brett-hulsey (democrat party)

"Statement: McCain ""hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign.""
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: elections,ethics

Analysis: Okay, so McCain has clearly set a policy that forbids current federal lobbyists from drawing a campaign paycheck and campaign officials say they are in full compliance with that. But the policy comes more than a year into the campaign. Current lobbyists hired by the campaign may have now been purged, but the fact is they were hired."

Analysis: Clinton said that when terrorists killed more than 250 Americans in Lebanon under Ronald Reagan, ""the Democrats didnt make that a partisan issue. ""Clinton has a strong point that the Democrat-held House did not react as forcefully to the 1983 Beirut bombings as the Republican-held House reacted to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four.

Analysis: So back to the question at hand. How accurate was Haridopolos in stating, ""This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years? ""His comment wasn't clear that he was referring only to the state Senatewith ""multiple seats,"" and he could have been slightlymore accurate by specifying since the late 1980s.

Analysis: Priebus said its not a big deal a Bush isnt attending the 2016 convention, because a Bush didnt speak in 2012 and ""there was no President Bush"" at the 2008 convention. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. In 2008, George W.  Bush addressed delegates via a live video feed, but former President George H. W.

"Statement: Crime is rising.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice

Analysis: Speaking generally about the state of the country, Trump said, ""Crime is rising. In fact, crime rates have been falling almost without fail for roughly a quarter-century. UPDATE, July 5, 2016: After we published our article, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post critiquing our analysis. The post cited preliminary figures for 2015 that show crime rising. Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trumps statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didnt say that crime was rising ""recently"" or ""in recent months"" or ""over the past year"" or ""in some places. ""Ultimately, we find that Trumps sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline and beset by crime ignores the overall trend of violent and property crime rates over the past 25 years, which is that they have fallen, consistently and significantly."
"Statement: (Flint, Mich., is) paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: city-government,water

Analysis: Sanders said,""You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt. , for clean water. ""Going back to January 2015, we find thats the case, as long as we include both water rates and water meter charges in Flint. But after a judge rolled Flints rates back in August 2015, people there are paying a little more than twice as much as people in Burlington. His numbers are no longer entirely accurate, butSanders has a point that Flints water bills are gallingly expensive."
"Statement: Weve got a personal tax system thats so complicated it costs Americans about $500 billion a year to comply with the current tax code.
Speaker: john-boehner (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Added together, this is likely a bit lower than the Tax Foundations projected 2011 figure of $392 billion and significantly lower than the $500 billion figure. Boehner, as did Perry, made a valid point -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But their numbers are not close to accurate, and a huge part of the dollar cost they mention is not money that anyone actually spends. Rather, it is the value placed on the time people take for preparation."
"Statement: Says a Portland school gives Muslim students their own school provided prayer room, prayer rugs, and lets them out of class five times a day to pray to Allah.

"Statement: The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon other than these drug gangs taking on one another end up being shot with their own weapon.
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)
Topic: guns

Analysis: Biden said ""the bulk"" of people who are shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon. The numbers that back up that statement refer only to fatal shootings, including a high proportion of suicides. CDC figures show, and our experts verified, that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and the majority of suicides are committed with a persons own gun or a gun owned by someone in the household. Although the numbers for non-fatal shootings are rough, such assaults typically don't involve the use of the victim's gun, experts told us."
"Statement: In the case of General Motors, the (Bush) administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change.
Speaker: rahm-emanuel (democrat party)
Topic: corporations,financial-regulation,market-regulation,abc-news-week,transportation

Analysis: Despite their different political parties and policy perspectives, President Bush stressed that we needed to provide his successor with the time and space he would need in the opening weeks of his Presidency. ""The Obama administration continued loaning GM money that wasn't repaid until April 2010, and the government still owns a majority ofGM stock in connection with the company's June 2009 bankruptcy. Emanuel's statement -- ""In the case of General Motors, the (Bush) administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change"" -- implies that the Obama administration was tough while the Bush administration just threw money at the problem. Actually, the Bush administration detailed a number of conditions for change at General Motors, and Obama's administration could have recalled the loans soon after taking office if officials felt the auto companies were not compliant."

"Statement: Says Miami Congressman Carlos Curbelo supports drilling offshore and repeatedly voted against President Obamas ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.
Speaker: democratic-congressional-campaign-committee (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change,environment

Analysis: The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change. ""Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Floridas coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change."
"Statement: When President, then candidate, Obama was asked to disclose some of his donors because there was suspicion of their being the foreign source of money into his campaign, they refused to do it.
Speaker: michael-steele (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance,transparency

Analysis: The campaign had names, and in most cases assurances from the donors, that they were American citizens. The allegation in the Washington Post story was that the campaign's vetting of foreign donations was not stringent enough up front. There was no issue of the Obama campaign willfully refusing to disclose the names of foreign donors. In fact, it was the disclosure of those names that allowed AP reporters to discover some of the donations were improper."
"Statement: Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.
Speaker: dennis-richardson (republican party)
Topic: health-care,state-budget

Analysis: Oregon is one of two states that covers a full range of benefits -- health, dental and vision -- but its one of at least four that covers the premiums for its lowest-cost health plan. Richardsons larger point, that Oregon is in a shrinking group of states that do so is certainly a strong and valid one. However, he undercuts his argument by resorting to hyperbole."
"Statement: You wonder why you dont see Rand Paul as much; hes still shopping for his billionaire. Hes like the only one who hasnt found a billionaire to fund his super PAC.
Speaker: claire-mccaskill (democrat party)
Topic: campaign-finance

Analysis: McCaskill said Pauls failure to gain traction in the crowded GOP field may have something to do with the fact that Paul is the only candidate to have not found his billionaire. There are two problems with this statement. There are candidates running for president who dont have a billionaire, and Paul has a reported billionaire backer in Yass."
"Statement: Says Donald Trump cashed in on Sept. 11,collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected.
Speaker: joseph-crowley (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget,terrorism

Analysis: Crowley said Trump ""cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover  even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected. ""Trump did receive a grant for his building at 40 Wall Street, which was less than a mile away from the Trade Center, but the property was eligible under the grant criteria. He also did say in 2001 that his properties were not affected by the attack, although he likely meant physically. The grant also provided compensation for economic losses."
"Statement: Three years ago, a newly elected President Obama told America that if Congress approved his plan to borrow nearly a trillion dollars, he would hold unemployment below 8 percent.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: stimulus

Analysis: In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment."

"Statement: Under a bill before the legislature, youd have to go to court to fire an employee.
Speaker: kenneth-block (republican party)

"Statement: There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used.
Speaker: michael-doherty (republican party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: A state DOT report showed some decreases in certain types of crashes and the costs of damages, but emphasized that the data collected through June 1, 2011 is too small to make definitive decisions about the cameras effectiveness."
"Statement: In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready.
Speaker: chris-christie (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: In his ""State of the State"" address, Christie said: ""In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready. ""But that statistic does not refer to high school graduates in 2013. It refers to the three 12th-graders enrolled during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and received a combined score of at least 1550, a benchmark developed by the College Board to measure college readiness."
"Statement: Says nearly 29,000 Oregonians almost 5 percent of all homeowners are 90 days or more delinquent on their mortgage.
Speaker: ellen-rosenblum (democrat party)
Topic: housing

Analysis: However, CoreLogics data is the same data used by the federal reserve. If its good enough for them, we figure its good enough for us. In introducing a revised mediation program, Rosenblum wrote that the housing crash lingers and that nearly 5 percent of all homeowners are more than 90 days delinquent on their mortgage. We verified that her figures were right and that 5 percent does, indeed, represent a number well above what wed experience before the recession."
"Statement: Under the Hate Crimes bill, ""any pastor, preacher, priest, rabbi or imam who gives a sermon out of their moral traditions about sexual practices could be found guilty of a federal crime.""
Speaker: john-kline (republican party)
Topic: crime

Analysis: ""I don't see how anyone who has read the language of the legislation could come to that conclusion,"" Moulton said. We certainly think it's fair for Republicans to criticize the decision to add this controversial hate crime provision to a bill that funds the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The language of the bill makes abundantly clear that it would not."
"Statement: This is what President Obama said the jobless rate would be if we passed the stimulus: 5.6 percent.
Speaker: american-crossroads (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,economy,jobs,message-machine-2012,stimulus

Analysis: Rather, he introduced ""projections"" that included a chart showing the jobless rate falling to 5. 6 percent under a recovery plan. The report highlighted the estimates ""significant margins of error"" and high uncertainty due to a recession that was ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity. ""The economy was, in fact, much worse than economists knew. The chart is now infamous, but it was never pitched as a promise."
"Statement: George Allen and his colleagues in the Senate turned the biggest surplus in the history of the United States into the biggest deficit in the history of the United States.
Speaker: tim-kaine (democrat party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,deficit

Analysis: Kaine said Allen, during his term in the Senate, was part of a Republican majority that turned the largest surplus in U. S.  history into the nations biggest deficit up until then. Kaine relied on raw numbers that do show the surplus peaked a few months before Allen took office and then dove into a record deficit during Allens term. But analysts said Kaines numbers -- which are unadjusted for inflation and do not take into account the size of the U. S.  economy at the time -- are a weak basis for historical comparison. Several analysts told us the best historical measure comes from looking at annual surpluses and deficits as a percentage of the nations GDP for a given year. By that gauge, although the U. S.  had high deficits during Allens term, they were not close to record-setting. So Kaines statement is accurate in terms of raw numbers, but it frays when historical context is added."
"Statement: Says President Obama has cracked down on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president.
Speaker: debbie-wasserman-schultz (democrat party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Wasserman Schultz said that Obama has cracked down ""on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president. ""She used the word ""employers"" and not ""employees"" here for a reason: Obama shifted away from Bushs strategy of workplace raids and turned the focus on employers. Between 2008 and 2009, immigration audits soared from 503 to more than 8,000. But other metric tell a more nuanced story. Final orders against employers, for example, were higher in the 1990s than they are now."
"Statement: Says Newt Gingrich made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion.
Speaker: michele-bachmann (republican party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: Bachmann said of Gingrich, ""When he was in Washington, D. C. , he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion. ""She correctly stated what Gingrich told the RNC in 1998. She even used his exact words to describe partial-birth abortion, calling it a ""barbaric procedure. ""Gingrich said he was being a pragmatist in order to maintain a majority in Congress so that it could successfully ban the procedure. He said hed campaign for all Republicans, even those to the left of him, because he didnt think party leaders should be ""purging"" Republican candidates and dictating to voters whom they should choose. Bachmann left out that context and thus, gave an incomplete impression of Gingrichs position."
"Statement: U.S. global AIDS spending helped reduce political instability and violence by 40 percent in recipient nations.
Speaker: tom-daschle (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy,public-health

Analysis: Daschle said that U. S.  global AIDS spending helped reduce ""political instability and violence"" by ""40 percent"" in recipient nations. No one questions that the program did much to ease the burden of disease and helped many sufferers. But there are several reasons the argument that it led to political stability is difficult to make. As the report Daschle cited notes, many of the countries were on an upward path before PEPFAR began. On top of that, Washington carefully selected which nations to include in PEPFAR. Finally, experts knew of no study that shows a large scale health intervention reducing instability and violence. On the contrary, and specific to HIV/AIDS, no study has found that the disease causes instability. Daschles statement treats correlation as if it were causation. Senator     U. S.  global AIDS spending helped reduce ""political instability and violence"" by ""40 percent"" in recipient nations."
"Statement: I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere.
Speaker: sarah-palin (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,transportation

Analysis: Today, when Palin says ""I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere,"" it implies Congress said, ""Here's a check for that bridge"" and she responded, ""No thanks, that's wasteful spending; here's your money back. ""Fact is, Alaska took the bridge money, and then just spent it on other projects. Palin did make the final call to kill plans for the bridge, but by the time she did it was no longer a politically viable project."
"Statement: The actual (construction) contracts that weve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates.
Speaker: jeff-morales (state-official party)
Topic: state-budget,state-finances,transportation

Analysis: Jeff Morales, the rail authoritys chief executive officer, said in late October: ""The actual (construction) contracts that weve awarded to date have come in several hundred million dollars below estimates. ""After digging out the original documents, the winning bids are a combined $480 million below the authoritys cost estimates. That works out to ""several hundred"" million. Still, the lower bids do nothing to wipe away the overall projects financial uncertainty, several experts said. Itsfunding gap remainsin the tens of billions of dollars. The implication behind Morales statement about the bids is that the authority is either controlling its costs or could potentially save money. Officials probably wouldnt talk about the bids otherwise. Even the authoritys chairman said theres no way to safeguard against all possible higher expenses. The phrase ""to date"" in the CEOs carefully worded comment may be the most critical going forward. Even so, our fact checks evaluate the here and now, and not predictions."
"Statement: State school funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation.
Speaker: virginia-education-association (none party)
Topic: education,state-budget

Analysis: The VEA says the states ""funding per pupil is down 16 percent compared to 2009, after adjusting for inflation. ""Data we gathered shows that Virginias funding per student, when adjusted for inflation, dropped by roughly 16. 3 percent between the 2008-09 school and the 2013-14 year."
"Statement: Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent during the presidents first year in office to 8.5 percent today.
Speaker: hank-johnson (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: But from October 2009 to December 2011, the economy gained jobs. Nonfarm payrolls actually rose by about 2. 4 million. Unemployment dropped from 10 percent to 8. 5 percent. Its easy to cherry-pick data that give opposite impressions of the nations economic health."
"Statement: American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year.
Speaker: causa-oregon (organization party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: The combined results of those polls, not unlike the controversy surrounding proposed immigration reform, were all over the map. So do seven in 10 Americans support letting illegal immigrants remain in the U. S.  with an added bonus of a pathway to citizenship?Apparently so, according to several polls -- but only if you dont remind respondents that someone ""broke the rules"" coming here in the first place. Adding that phrase, according to other polls, yielded a far different answer."
"Statement: There were more people on welfare than working in 2013.
Speaker: terry-jeffrey (none party)
Topic: economy,jobs,poverty,welfare

Analysis: Jeffrey said that in 2013, there were 109,631,000 Americans ""on welfare,"" outnumbering the ""105,862,000 full-time year-round workers in the United States. ""The number of ""welfare"" recipients -- unlike the number of workers -- is enlarged by the inclusion of children and senior citizens."
"Statement: Says Tammy Baldwin introduced a bill that would require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity.
Speaker: glenn-grothman (republican party)
Topic: children,gays-and-lesbians,health-care,sexuality

Analysis: Baker, of the Center for American Progress, said HHS is working on adding sexual orientation to its National Health Interview Survey, which is done randomly by telephone. Our rating    Grothman said Baldwin introduced a bill to require doctors and other health care workers to ask patients, ""including young children, whether they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or if they know their gender identity. ""But there was no requirement that doctors or other health care workers question their patients."
"Statement: Says State Rep. Kristi Thibaut was an ACORN lobbyist.
Speaker: republican-party-texas (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: ""We've never hid from this. ""In an e-mail, Murray suggested the GOP attack is a red herring: ""This is a real stretch to equate her work here in Texas, where ACORN was never, to my knowledge, implicated in any 'fraud,' with the salacious accusations leveled at the organization in other states."
"Statement: Atlanta is the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America. Between 100 and 200 girls are sold into slavery in Atlanta every month.
Speaker: jimmy-carter (democrat party)
Topic: children

Analysis: Both the media outlets and the former president could have done a better job. Part of Carters statement accurately quotes the estimates that are out there on the girls involved. The part about Atlanta being ""the No. 1 trading point for sexual slavery in America"" is off base."
"Statement: According to a national survey, transit ridership among people age 16 to 34 increased 40 percent between 2001 and 2009.
Speaker: jeff-dickerson (none party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: But Dickersons use of the word ""ridership"" might have led viewers to think that younger people are taking 40 percent more trips on transit. This number ticked up by only about 4 percent. By either NHTS measure, its fair to say that younger people are leaving Daddys T-Bird in the driveway and relying more heavily on transit. But Dickerson could have been much more precise."
"Statement: In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan.
Speaker: oregon-2014 (organization party)
Topic: abortion,taxes

Analysis: Oregon is among a minority of states that allow using state taxpayer money for elective abortions. Petitioners hope to change that by adding these words to the Constitution: ""No public funds shall be used to pay for any abortion, except when medically necessary or as may be required by federal law. ""We may see this measure on the 2014 ballot; we may not. But it is accurate to say that state taxpayer money paid for about 4,000 abortions in the most recent year available."
"Statement: Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June.
Speaker: thomas-tobin (none party)
Topic: gays-and-lesbians,marriage

Analysis: Bishop Thomas Tobin urged the General Assembly to delay consideration of any same-sex marriage legislation in Rhode Island because, ""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. ""But the question of whether to allow same-sex marriage -- the topic of the bills being considered by the state legislature -- is not what the U. S.  Supreme Court is considering. The court is looking at the constitutionality of laws intent on blocking same-sex marriage. As a result, except for an unexpected decision by the court to allow same-sex marriage nationwide, approval of either General Assembly bill is not going to be affected by what the justices decide in June."
"Statement: Im the only (Republican)candidate that has actually reduced the size of government.
Speaker: bobby-jindal (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,state-budget

Analysis: Jindal said, ""Im the only candidate that has actually reduced the size of government. ""He was talking about the cuts in spending. However, theres more than one way of looking at spending cuts. One other approach that an expert said is valid suggests that Jindal was out-cut by four other governors."
"Statement: After how hard you work and how much you pay in taxes, New York City ends up getting the money. Im Chris Jacobs. I think its time we have someone in Albany thats making sure our region gets our fair share
Speaker: chris-jacobs (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Data obtained from the Department of Budget shows Western New York, including Erie County, consistently receives a bigger percentage share of state spending than its residents percentage contribution in taxes. Jacobs implies the region is not getting its fair share. Data shows its getting more than its fair share in the states largest spending categories. There are a few categories in which New York City receives more than it puts in, but overall, the difference between how much is paid in taxes and how much is spent on services and projects benefits Western New York - not New York City."
"Statement: Amazing fact: Senate has already voted on more amendments in 2015 than Reid allowed ALL YEAR last year.

"Statement: Says state Supreme Court candidate Joe Donald twice supported incumbent Justice Rebecca Bradley.
Speaker: joanne-kloppenburg (none party)
Topic: candidates-biography,criminal-justice,elections,legal-issues,campaign-advertising

Analysis: So, in contrast to the first instance, when Donalds support for Bradley was unilateral, his support in the second instance was split. Our rating Kloppenburg says Donald twice ""supported"" Bradley. Donald explicitly endorsed Bradley in a 2013 election for the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When there was a vacancy on the state appeals court in 2015, Donald supported Bradley by allowing her to use him as a reference in her application, although he also recommended that the governor choose a different applicant for the post."

"Statement: There were 36 states where Republicans who were in charge refused to implement a state (health insurance) exchange.
Speaker: debbie-wasserman-schultz (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,supreme-court

Analysis: There are 36 states that use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships instead of state-based marketplaces. But seven of those states are run by Democrats. And, some of the states with Republican governors, like New Mexico and Idaho, tried to institute a state exchange before opting for federally-facilitated marketplace. So while most of the 36 states had Republican governors, not all of them did."
"Statement: Says a tweet he sent out wasnt saying, check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the background of Alicia Machado.

"Statement: Aphotograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton featured a Confederate battle flag in the background.

Topic: candidates-biography,history

Analysis: DSouza tweeted out to nearly 200,000 followers a photograph of 21-year-old Hillary Clinton that appeared to feature a Confederate battle flag in the background. But as a look at the original images makes clear, the photograph has been manipulated to include the flag, and DSouzas accompanying comment in the tweet doesnt indicate that he was aware of the fakery. (He later corrected the tweet."
"Statement: Texas leads the nation in the percentage of residents without health insurance.
Speaker: paul-krugman (none party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: California landed fifth, with 21. 9 percent. And Massachusetts, which requires residents older than 18 to have health coverage, ranked again as the state with the smallest percentage of uninsured residents: 4. 9 percent. Gallup said it interviewed 176,193 adults from Jan.  2-June 30, 2010. By available indicators, Texas has the nations highest percentage of uninsured residents."
"Statement: This administration and this Congress have been systematically cutting funding to border security since the Democrats took control.

Analysis: Funding for fencing is down, but funding for border security is up. In fact, discretionary spending on border security is up 55 percent between 2007 and 2011, even with a small proposed cut in 2011."
"Statement: A new college tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents.
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)
Topic: education,state-budget,states

Analysis: Walker said the new tuition reciprocity agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota makes college ""more affordable for Wisconsin residents. ""But the new agreement doesnt make attending school in Minnesota any more affordable. In fact, its just the opposite. By eliminating supplementary payments from the state, the typical reciprocity student from Wisconsin will have to pay $1,400 more in tuition each year, based on 2010-2011 figures."
"Statement: Says Cory Booker supports late-term and partial-birth abortion and opposes safety regulations.
Speaker: bookerfail (none party)
Topic: abortion,health-care,women

Analysis: A spokeswoman for one of the groups behind the ad notes that Bookers stance on abortion comes from his support of the Democratic National Committees 2012 platform, which Booker co-chaired. The platform, though, makes no mention of late-term or partial-birth abortion, which a Booker spokesman agreed the Democrat would support a womans right to choose ifher life or health is in danger. The platform says nothing else about safety regulations, which some states  such as Texas  have cited in attempts to ban abortion after a certain point in pregnancy."
"Statement: Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.
Speaker: debbie-wasserman-schultz (democrat party)

Analysis: Wasserman Schultz said, ""Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns.

"Statement: In the month of July alone, EU exports to South Korea increased by over 36 percent. A lot of that is our market share. Those are our farmers and our service providers who are suffering.
Speaker: rob-portman (republican party)
Topic: trade

Analysis: The senator accurately quoted the trade stats he obtained from the Korean embassys August 25 news release. It is contradicted by the data for August trade available from Koreas Ministry of Knowledge Economy released two days before Portman spoke. And statistics for the six months before the EU trade agreement kicked in show EU trade growth."
"Statement: Gov. Rick Perry spent over a million dollars on D.C. lobbyists asking for more federal money and lives in a luxury house that costs taxpayers $10,000 a month.
Speaker: kay-bailey-hutchison (republican party)
Topic: ethics,transparency

Analysis: According to Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark, the utility doesn't release how much electricity any customer uses. But the average electric bill for a home of similar square footage would run about $250 a month, assuming the home is heated by gas. The bottom line: Hutchison is correct that state offices controlled by Perry or his appointees spent more than $1 million on Washington lobbyists."

Speaker: american-crossroads (republican party)
Topic: economy,jobs,message-machine-2012

Analysis: American Crossroads said that while Kaine was governor and chairman of the DNC, Virginia lost more than 65,000 jobs. That number checks out and we could make an argument that the job loss was higher. But every state saw unemployment rise from January 2009 to January 2010. Virginias unemployment rate remained well below the national average. Governors have little control over their state economies in good times or bad. The suggestion that Kaine could have inoculated Virginia from a national recession had he not been DNC chairman is unrealistic."
"Statement: The DNC says McCain flip-flopped on whether the Iraq War would be easy.
Speaker: democratic-national-committee (none party)
Topic: iraq

Analysis: As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency. (see Politifact ""McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq"" and ""One man sacrificed for his country"")    Yes, McCain predicted it would be an easy war and that Americans would be greeted by the Iraqis as liberators. But Hussein's regime was toppled relatively quickly and McCain advocated early on that the U. S.  needed more troops and resources to prevent just such an entrenched insurgency as has come to pass."
"Statement: Says Ohio law gives tax breaks to rich people who own private jets.
Speaker: mike-foley (democrat party)
Topic: state-budget,taxes

Analysis: The tax break, however, only applies to fractional ownership programs. Thats additional information that provides clarity. And to his credit, Foley did mention fractional ownership at a different point in his speech on the House floor."

Speaker: americans-job-security (none party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,message-machine,stimulus,taxes,voting-record

Analysis: The ad also mischaracterizes cap-and-and trade legislation as an energy tax. Space did vote for cap-and-trade, the 2010 budget and the stimulus."
"Statement: Says Paul Ryans budget plan ends Medicare.
Speaker: rob-zerban (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget,health-care,medicare,message-machine-2012

Analysis: But Ryan later proposed allowing beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. So, Medicare would remain the same for people 55 and over and it would remain an option for those who are younger. People 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare, while those who today are under 55 could use a voucher they would receive to buy either a private insurance plan or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare."
"Statement: In every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, theres been an investigative subcommittee thats been established first.
Speaker: alan-grayson (democrat party)
Topic: ethics

Analysis: Grayson said that in every ethics case that has resulted in a formal sanction, ""there's been an investigative subcommittee that's been established first. ""The formal sanctions he cited were expulsion, censure and reprimand, all of which are exceedingly rare punishments. There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case  the case of Wilson yelling ""you lie!"" a formal reprimand came via a largely party-lineresolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later."
"Statement: Says New Hampshire has the third-highest property tax in the country.
Speaker: jackie-cilley (democrat party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,taxes

Analysis: Using Census data, the leading tax advocacy organizations show that New Hampshire ranks third, behind only Connecticut and New Jersey, in property tax charges. Its worth noting, though, that Cilley does not paint a full picture of the Granite States overall tax landscape. Looking at overall tax burden, New Hampshire residents fund the government with a relatively low percentage of their incomes in comparison to other states."
"Statement: Obama's tax plan cuts taxes ""for 95 percent of all working families.""
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: IRS data show that 97 percent of tax filers make less than $200,000, so there are even two percentage points worth of leeway there. UPDATE:    Since we published this item, the Tax Policy Center researched how Obama's tax proposals would affect workers. They concluded 94. 3 percent of workers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan;     read their research here    ."
"Statement: Says Colorado Democraticcongressional candidate MorganCarroll racked up $11 billion in new spending in the state Legislature.
Speaker: national-republican-congressional-committee (republican party)
Topic: state-budget

Analysis: The NRCC said Morgan Carroll ""racked up $11 billion in new spending,"" implying that she had a key role in ""nearly doubling the state budget. ""Carroll did vote for a $25 billion budget in 2015, but the Democrat was joined by a vast majority of lawmakers in a Republican-controlled Senate. The budgets passage was hailed as a bipartisan accomplishment by both parties. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. While the NRCC adfocuses on the total budget, lawmakers control is largely limited to the general fund, which in 2015 was 38. 4 percent of the overall budget."

"Statement: Carol Shea-Porter wants to increase taxes on small business and job creators.
Speaker: frank-guinta (republican party)
Topic: small-business

Analysis: ""Policymakers ought not let myths and lobbyists slogans regarding high-income taxpayers and small businesses drive them toward a costly policy that would add heavily to deficits while delivering little economic benefit. ""Our ruling:    As Guinta suggests, Shea-Porter both lobbied and voted against extending the Bush tax cuts before she left office in 2010, calling the matter ""fiscally irresponsible"" and ""grossly unfair"" to middle class Americans."
"Statement: People were hopeless. Sixty percent of the population, 70 percent of the population wanted to live somewhere else. . . . By the time I left, 70 percent wanted to stay.
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)

"Statement: A bill delaying the start of classes until Labor Day would permit school districts to shave 5 full weeks off the school year.
Speaker: marc-schare (none party)
Topic: education,tourism

Analysis: And knowing how schools would then react would require the ability to predict the future. While the numbers he used apply specifically to his Worthington district, he shows in his posted testimony that most districts in central Ohio would feel similar results. Regardless, in the statement we're checking, Schare said only that HB 191 would permit the 5-week shorter year, not require it."
"Statement: On whether the United States should intervene in Libya.
Speaker: newt-gingrich (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,military

Analysis: So where does this leave us?Gingrich has a point that Obamas March 3 declaration about Gadhafi had consequences, and if Gingrich had provided that context of his thinking in both interviews, he could have made a reasonable argument that the two statements were consistent."
"Statement: 99.97 percent of the kids live in poverty that attend Cleveland public schools.
Speaker: sandra-williams (democrat party)
Topic: education,poverty

Analysis: Her figure of 99. 97 percent would mean all but roughly 13 students in the district live in poverty. If the states 95 percent figure is correct, that would mean about 2,100 students are not living in poverty. If the poverty percentage is at 89 percent (the figure the state used for students eligible for free and reduced meals for the 2010-11 school year), it would mean 4,600 students are not living in poverty."
"Statement: John Kitzhaber created 128,000 new jobs while governor.
Speaker: john-kitzhaber (democrat party)
Topic: economy,job-accomplishments

Analysis: The economy was not a central concern for most of his administration. Kitzhaber played a role in making Oregon more attractive to business, but the global and national economies played a larger role in Oregons success."
"Statement: Says Texas ranks 49th nationally in what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state.
Speaker: wendy-davis (democrat party)
Topic: education,state-budget,state-finances,states

Analysis: Davis said Texas ranks 49th in ""what we are doing to support our per-pupil investment in education in the state. ""A report drawing on states figures estimates Texas is spending $7,886 or $8,400 per student this year, depending on how students are counted. Both ways, Texas ranks third to last among the states. But the senator focused on state investment which, unlike locally determined debt and capital outlays, are driven by legislative actions. Our sense is that this is the appropriate comparison, though Davis failed to clarify that Texas is 49th by this yardstick in comparison to other states plus Washington, D. C. , which is not a state."
"Statement: Despite keeping distance from national media interviewers, I did local press all along, the last three months.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: job-accomplishments,states

Analysis: In her first sit-down interview with a national television reporter, Hillary Clinton said, ""I did local press all along, the last three months. ""A review of Clintons interactions with the media during the first three months of her campaign shows that she offered numerous interviews with local news outlets during the third month of that time frame. Prior to that, however, her interactions with with local news outlets were just about as scarce as they were with national outlets. Its an exaggeration for her to say that she had been engaging with reporters at the local level for three months."
"Statement: What we said was, you can keep (your plan) if it hasnt changed since the law passed.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: According to Obama, ""What we said was you can keep (your plan) if it hasnt changed since the law passed. ""But we found at least 37 times since Obamas inauguration where he or a top administration official made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it, and we never found an instance in which he offered the caveat that it only applies to plans that hadnt changed after the laws passage. And seven of those 37 cases came after the release of the HHS regulations that defined the ""grandfathering"" process, when the impact would be clear. While Sebelius teleconference with reporters did provide that sort of caveat, in other instances, such as her blog post, she focused on the upside, not the downside. Her one mention of the extent to which grandfathered plans might be doomed strikes us as the equivalent of the fine print on a television commercial running in heavy rotation. Obama is ignoring the overwhelming majority of times he addressed the issue, where most people would have heard it."
"Statement: In 2006, Bernie Sanders voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Clinton said that in 2006, Bernie Sanders ""voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minutemen who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants. ""That said, Clinton glosses over the degree to which Democrats -- and not just Republicans -- supported both measures."
"Statement: Says Florida didnt offer special incentives to Deutsche Bank, which announced it will add 300 jobs in Florida.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: We are not evaluating whether Deutsche Bank finds several things about Florida attractive for expanding its company: the weather, the lack of income tax, etc. We are looking at Scotts response to a pointed question in his Fox News interview: Did Florida offer ""something special"" to Deutsche Bank in exchange for 300 jobs?Scott could have acknowledged that economic incentives were used in the deal. Instead he said they were not. Records show the company is ready to receive up to $2. 08 million in state and local incentives if it hits its job targets."
"Statement: Says she was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.
Speaker: katie-mcginty (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Shes elided this statement further through the course of her campaign. But documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelors of arts, and the university confirmed to Buzzfeed he started attending the school in 1971. John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGintys website and at other times throughout her campaign doesnt include this important distinction."
"Statement: There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians dont want our money.
Speaker: rand-paul (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,polls

Analysis: Paul said, ""There was a Gallup poll in Egypt last year, and 70 percent of Egyptians don't want our money. ""That actually understates what Gallup found. One of the firms polls from April 2012 found that 82 percent of Egyptians opposed such aid. Other polls and regional experts confirm the existence of such levels of opposition."
"Statement: The truth of the matter is that during my administration, the FBI's crime statistics show that violent crime was reduced in Massachusetts by 7 percent.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: crime

Analysis: The robbery rate increased from 111. 5 to 125. So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up?The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14. 6 percent."
"Statement: Scott Maddox has run ""losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions.""
Speaker: adam-putnam (republican party)
Topic: agriculture,candidates-biography

Analysis: ""The minor offense in this case is counting Maddox's run for governor as a run for Cabinet. The governor isn't a member of the Cabinet, according to the state Constitution. But that's not what has us worried. Putnam errs in counting Maddox's 2010 bid for agriculture commissioner as a losing campaign. Maddox lost a campaign for attorney general and pulled out of a run for governor. The third race is still up in the air."
"Statement: Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year on tax preparation.
Speaker: virginia-foxx (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Its important to note that the figure is an estimate. It comes from taking the number of tax forms filed in the last year and multiplying it by the IRSs estimate of the time it takes to prepare the forms. Foxxs larger point, that it takes a very long time for Americans to comply with filing their federal taxes, is accurate. The number is an estimate, but its from a credible, independent report."
"Statement: The budget I managed at the Department of Education was more than $60 million.
Speaker: clay-pell (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,education,federal-budget,job-accomplishments

Analysis: But he only actually administered a portion of that budget."
"Statement: We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: energy,environment,gas-prices,trade

Analysis: Clinton said, ""We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent. ""The United States imports more energy than it exports, and it consumes more energy than it produces domestically. So the United States still relies on foreign energy sources for about 11 percent of its energy consumption needs. However, this import-export gap is trending down. The EIA predicts the United States energy exports and imports will balance in the not-so-distant future. That said, imports and exports have been balanced in previousdecades. The United States is on track to energy independence, but its not there yet."
"Statement: Last year, Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: corporations,energy

Analysis: We have dinged politicians for inaccurately characterizing the companys taxes. )The company has a point that Obamas statistic doesn't detail the oil company's expenses. As a simple snapshot of Exxons 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target."
"Statement: AARP is ""the largest reseller of insurance in the country"" and ""has a vested interest in seeing that the market for reselling supplemental insurance expands.""
Speaker: ginny-brown-waite (republican party)
Topic: health-care,legal-issues,medicare

Analysis: Is it the largest licensee?It might be  it certainly makes millions  but there is little data to confirm or refute that it is the largest. Does it have an interest?Yes, although we can't conclusively say health reform will lead to more money for AARP."
"Statement: Medicare monthly premiums will go up to $104.20 in 2012 and $247.00 in 2014 due to provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation, purposely delayed so as not to confuse the 2012 re-election campaigns.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: health-care,medicare

Analysis: And in fact, most Medicare beneficiaries will only pay $3. 50 more a month in 2012. The e-mails projection for 2014 seems entirely fabricated. The health care law leaves in place the long-established methods for calculating Medicare Part B premiums."
"Statement: Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level.
Speaker: bill-proctor (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Proctor said ""Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level. ""The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent."
"Statement: Says Republican Sen. John McCain won more votes for president in Cuyahoga County in the 2008 general election than he did in seven states.
Speaker: kevin-dewine (republican party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: The countys population in the 2010 census of 1,280,122 makes it more populous than six of the seven states in the comparison. Only Hawaii, which has 1,360,301 residents, is bigger. Wyoming is the smallest with 563,626 residents."
"Statement: Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika).
Speaker: naral-pro-choice (organization party)
Topic: abortion,congress,health-care

Analysis: NARALs TV ad said, ""Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika). ""The text on the screen stated that Rubio ""voted against contraception and family planning. Actually, he has repeatedly supported Zika funding requests, including $1. 9 billion sought by Obama. The ad cherry-picks votes by zeroing in on Rubios votes on measures that would have blocked funding to the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. The ad doesnt explain that despite that block, the bill still could have provided money to fight Zika both in Puerto Rico and the United States. Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue."
"Statement: Youre in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car.
Speaker: john-pagliarini (republican party)
Topic: children,criminal-justice,public-safety

Analysis: In his amendment, which he hopes will be up for vote later this month, a parent or caregiver would face the similar penalties as in the animal bill if they leave a child under 7 unattended in a car for more than 5 minutes. Our ruling  Sen.  Pagliarini says ""Youre in more trouble if you leave your pet in the car than if you leave your child in the car. ""We looked at the laws, and at face value, hes right. But, through the power of the DCYF, police, hospital staff and child neglect statutes like Brendans Law, parents or caregivers can get in a heap of trouble if they leave a child in these circumstances."
"Statement: SaysPeter Kilmartin voted in favor of expanding the good behavior statute to sex offenders.
Speaker: erik-wallin (republican party)
Topic: crime,voting-record

Analysis: But that is the result of a law that passed in 1976, when Kilmartin was 14 years old. It had nothing to do with the 2008 votes. But that doesn't change the fact that he accused his opponent of voting in favor of something he didn't vote for."
"Statement: On letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in Woodruff Park.
Speaker: kasim-reed (democrat party)
Topic: occupy-wall-street,public-safety

Analysis: City code required that the first order expire Oct.  17. The order does not say protesters would be removed after that date. Reeds office said three days before then that it was not a firm deadline for protesters to leave the park."
"Statement: What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: debt

Analysis: Clinton said, ""What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt. ""An independent analysis found Clintons proposals would add a relatively small amount to the debt, $200 billion over a decade. The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan will address that, though the proposal hasnt been independently analyzed. Regardless, Clintons explanation leaves out the fact that debt would still rise by about $9 trillion over 10 years because of current policies. Clintons proposals dont stem that increase. Clintons statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details."
"Statement: There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850.
Speaker: diego-arene-morley (activist party)
Topic: civil-rights,crime,criminal-justice,marijuana

Analysis: Our research found that U. S.  Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1. 68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1. 88 million with local jails factored in."
"Statement: In first week as governor, Tim Kaine proposed a nearly $4 billion tax increase, $4 billion, including a tax increase on people earning as little as $17,000 a year.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Trump said Kaine, during his first week as governor, proposed a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase"" that would have hit people earning as little as $17,000. Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a ""nearly $4 billion tax increase,"" citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span. The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car. So Trumps statement largely is accurate but needs some clarification."
"Statement: On Lee Fishers watch, almost nine out of 10 jobs that Ohio lost were lost to other states, not to other countries.

"Statement: Limiting labor negotiations to only wages is how it is for the most part in the private sector.
Speaker: alberta-darling (republican party)
Topic: labor,state-budget

Analysis: Its not just money, its the workplace. ""Lets return to Darlings statement. In arguing public employee unions ought to be treated more like their their private sector counterparts, she said ""for the most part"" private contract talks are limited to wages. However, the National Labor Relations Act make it clear: Private employers with unions are not only allowed to bargain on many other issues -- that law requires the subjects be about far more than just wages."
"Statement: Says on contraception, his plan is cheaper and easier for you than Sen. Mark Udalls
Speaker: cory-gardner (republican party)
Topic: health-care,message-machine-2014,women

Analysis: Gardner said his plan on contraceptives is ""cheaper and easier for you"" than Sen.  Mark Udalls plan. This is based on his support for a plan to allow for over-the-counter sales of the pill. Gardners plan is lacking in concrete details that would allow a thorough evaluation. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts  from advocates to economists  question whether Gardners proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act. And Gardners plan would only address one type of contraceptive, meaning the many people who choose other methods of birth control would see higher costs."
"Statement: The states have always defined marriage.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: gays-and-lesbians,marriage

Analysis: Rubio said, ""States have always defined marriage. ""Rubio has a point that states are generally in charge of administering marriage within their boundaries. However, his statement implies that state marriage regulations were untouched by the federal government up until the Supreme Courts decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and that is not the case. There are numerous 20th century examples of the Supreme Court overturning state marriage regulations that it found to be unconstitutional, including the 1967 decision to invalidate laws banning interracial marriages."
"Statement: Families in Del Valle, who are City of Austin residents, have to drive to Bastrop to go to the closest grocery store.
Speaker: delia-garza (none party)

Analysis: It may be more stressful to travel to Austin than Bastrop to shop and we can see how the lack of a nearby big grocery is distressing. However, several Austin grocery stores are closer -- by about 10 miles -- than the nearest equivalent Bastrop grocery."
"Statement: John McCain ""opposed legislation to fund levees and flood control programs, which he considers pork.""
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis:  one of Obama's most fervent campaign supporters  allied herself with McCain and Feingold's effort. McCain was out front in urging the Senate to reject the water resources bill and he has been consistent in branding the government's process for funding those projects to be an exercise in pork-barrel spending. But McCain is not just a naysayer on water projects, he has been advancing an argument about how spending priorities are set for water projects. And proposing a way to change it."
"Statement: Mitt Romneys pledged to protect (oil companies) record profits and their billions in special tax breaks, too.

Analysis: The Priorities USA Action ad says ""Mitt Romneys pledged to protect their (oil companies) record profits  and their billions in special tax breaks, too. ""We couldnt find any pledge from Romney to protect the oil industries tax breaks -- if anything, Romney appears to be trying to avoid making any clear statement on how he would handle those subsidies.

"Statement: State government spending will be increase 10.7 percent this year.
Speaker: john-kasich (republican party)
Topic: government-efficiency,job-accomplishments,state-budget

"Statement: Says Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he had nothing to do with that provision in the law.
Speaker: tommy-thompson (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,health-care,medicare

Analysis: Indeed, in 2007, when Democrats pushed legislation to repeal non-interference, Bush threatened a veto, arguing that competition among insurers was resulting in lower drug prices. Our rating    Thompson said Democrats first proposed prohibiting the government from negotiating prices for prescription drugs in Medicare Part D and he ""had nothing to do with"" that provision in the final law. Democrats did introduce a version of the so-called non-interference provision, but it didnt go as far as the provision that became law under Bush. Moreover, Thompson was the point man on Medicare Part D for the Bush administration, which supported non-interference."

Analysis: Lee said the FCCs net neutrality policy ""is essentially a massive tax increase. ""Literally, there wont be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. Theres a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year. Lees comment doesnt account for the fact that the impact on consumers service bills is far from certain, and a telecom policy analyst said it's an overstatement to call the potential increases ""massive."

"Statement: More people die from medical misadventures than firearm accidents nationally and in Florida.
Speaker: national-rifle-association (none party)
Topic: guns,health-care

Analysis: The government's 2007 data shows613 accidental firearm deaths nationwide compared to 2,248 deaths from medical care adverse effect. That's close to four times, as the NRA handout says. In Florida, there were16 accidental firearm deaths compared to 108 medical care adverse effect. That's almost seven times, even worse than the six times cited by the NRA. We have two concerns: The WISQARS data comes with a lot of caveats when examining medical errors, and even the gun data may not be perfect. And the NRA's fact-sheet ignores gun deaths from murders and suicides, which take a significantly higher toll than accidents and can't be ignored in the gun debate."
"Statement: When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran.
Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: A number of other countries have also increased their own bilateral sanctions against Iran in recent years. ""Biden would have had a strong case for high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he said what appeared to be his main point: the Obama administration has prodded the rest of the world to be tougher on Iran. But there is a disconnect with what the vice president actually said and U. N.  resolutions passed against Iran during the Bush administration. The resolutions seem to be a little more than ""virtually no international pressure on Iran."
"Statement: The minimum wage is mostly an entry-level wage for young people.
Speaker: mitch-mcconnell (republican party)
Topic: income

Analysis: The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that indeed half of all workers making a minimum wage are 16 to 24, and another 20 percent are in their late 20s or early 30s. Thats a large chunk of the minimum wage workforce, though about 30 percent of people making the minimum wage are 35 and older. McConnell also goes a bit too far in calling these jobs ""entry-level. ""For most young people, these are part-time jobs in the food or retail businesses or similar industries with little hope for career advancement."
"Statement: Says six studies verify that the math adds up for Mitt Romneys tax plan.
Speaker: paul-ryan (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Ryan said that six studies verify that the numbers in the Romney tax plan add up. Hearing that, you might think that each is independent research. But not all studies are created equal and these come from people or groups with ties to Romney. Two of those studies come from Feldstein, a Romney campaign adviser. Three come from conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, which have analysts who advise the Romney campaign. While every analyst would insist that they make their own judgments, the Tax Policy Center is fully independent of the Obama campaign. The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data. That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to. Of the studies that examine the middle class tax burden, none shows conclusively that households making less than $200,000 would be spared a tax increase. That is a group of taxpayers that Romney defines as middle class and says he would protect. None of the studies can accurately model Romneys tax plan because he has said so little about how he would pay for it. As a result, all of them make assumptions as to what tax breaks might be reduced. They can speak in rough terms about a concept, but they can not verify a plan when no detailed plan exists."
"Statement: In the United States, weve had 12 years in a row of wages declining.
Speaker: martin-omalley (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: OMalley said that in the United States, weve had ""12 years in a row of wages declining. ""He has a point that, using the most appropriate measure of compensation, weekly wages adjusted for inflation are lower now than they were 12 years ago."
"Statement: Charlie Crist has six different positions on ObamaCare.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: So we see three main positions here: Crist has said he was against the bill and wanted it repealed, Crist has said he would have voted for it, and Crist has said he wants to modify the bill. Where does that leave us?Rubio says Crist has had ""six different positions"" on the health care bill. We agree he has made conflicting statements about his views on the health care bill -- once it only took him two hours to contradict himself. But generally his positions can be summarized in three ways: he was opposed and wanted to repeal the law, he said he would have voted for the law, and he wants to modify the law."
"Statement: In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: afghanistan

Analysis: In fact, there are many questions surrounding the case, most notably who Zazi's co-conspirators might have been. The other two men arrested so far were charged with lying to investigators, not committing acts of terror. If a court had convicted Zazi, we would likely rate Obama's statement True. The Justice Department is backing Obama's statement, but these men have not been convicted."
"Statement: As governor, I've stood up to ... the big oil companies.
Speaker: sarah-palin (republican party)
Topic: energy

Analysis: ""In general, it's business as usual for oil companies in Alaska. ""Palin has supported the controversial idea of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and has sued the federal government to oppose listing the polar bear as an endangered species, which would curtail energy development. And that she did, with respect to taxes, Point Thomson leases and the North Slope pipeline."
"Statement: This year, were off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: Obama said, ""This year, we're off to our best private-sector jobs growth since 1999. ""The official statistics show that more jobs were created in the first six months of 2013 than in any equivalent period going back to 1999, but its worth noting that three other years came very close to the amount gained in 2013 -- so close that they were within the surveys margin of error."
"Statement: Says abortion doctors are flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out.
Speaker: matthew-hill (republican party)

Analysis: nan"
"Statement: Speaker Gingrich for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate for health insurance.
Speaker: rick-santorum (republican party)
Topic: health-care,legal-issues

Analysis: Santorum said Gingrich ""for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate. ""We found no references earlier than 1993, when Gingrich said ""I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. ""In the years since, he made repeated statements asserting that people who dont purchase insurance should have to do so or to post a bond, a concept he calls ""a variation"" on the mandate. While the specifics of Gingrichs viewpoint on the individual mandate have shifted -- ending with his opposition to it now -- its clear that for most of two decades he planted himself comfortably on the spectrum of compelling people to have health insurance."
"Statement: There have been at least 100 shootings each year [Angel Taveras] has been mayor of Providence.
Speaker: american-leadhership-pac (organization party)
Topic: candidates-biography,crime,guns,job-accomplishments,campaign-advertising,public-safety

Analysis: Before Taveras took office, the numbers were lower but steadily increasing. The annual total was 47 shootings in 2006 (during the tenure of his predecessor, David Cicilline), 58 in 2007, 77 in 2008, 86 in 2009, and 90 in 2010, Cicilline's final year, before jumping sharply to 108 during Taveras' first year."
"Statement: Maurice Ferre says Kendrick Meek has voted 98.6 percent of the time with the Democrat party.
Speaker: maurice-ferre (democrat party)
Topic: voting-record

Analysis: Similarly, Graham's percentages between 1991 and 2002 ranged from 81. 8 percent to 92. 9 percent. The Washington Post database keeps records back until 1991. Chiles left the U. S.  Senate in 1989."
"Statement: Weve created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: jobs

Analysis: Obama said, ""We've created more jobs in the United States than every other advanced economy combined since I came into office. ""Using a straight definition of advanced economic nations from the International Monetary Fund, Obama is slightly off. The United States has added less jobs than a group of 35 other advanced economic nations combined, not more. However, you can make the argument that two countries on the list -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- should be excluded. Whats equally and perhaps more noteworthy is that when you look at the rate of job growth, which accounts for population differences, the United States trails other advanced nations."
"Statement: One in four inmates is an illegal immigrant.
Speaker: lisa-boothe (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Republican strategist Lisa Boothe said on Fox News The OReilly Factor ""one in four inmates is an illegal immigrant. ""The data Boothe cited included immigrants who were here legally and illegally. So its likely that number is at least somewhat inflated. Federal agencies say they dont track data on inmates in the country illegally, and several immigration experts told us theres no definitive source for that specific number."
"Statement: Wisconsin is dead last in income growth among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walkers term.

Analysis: Scott Walkers three-plus years in office. The quarterly figures do put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point endorsed by the agency that compiled the information."
"Statement: A three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry.

"Statement: I have had the challenge during this administration to suspend no less than 37 public officials in about 36 months.
Speaker: charlie-crist (democrat party)
Topic: florida

Analysis: Crist told reporters he has had to ""suspend no less than 37 public officials"" since taking office in 2007. He's just about right on. The number actually includes people Cristremoved from office, a more severe punishment than suspension. And the final number includes the suspensions of eight public notaries -- not what most people think of when they hear ""public official."
"Statement: Kendrick Meek was #1 in Florida in taking tobacco cash and then opposed a tax on cigars that would have helped pay for childrens health care.

"Statement: Federal Reserve policies have led to a 69 percent rise in corn prices, 44 percent rise in wheat prices and 15 percent spike in sugar prices over the last year.
Speaker: jamie-radtke (republican party)
Topic: agriculture,energy,hunger

Analysis: Economists and a commodity trader told us these price spikes are primarily being driven by drought, floods and rising global demand. And while the value of the dollar plays a role in these prices, Federal Reserve policy is just one factor in the greenbacks value."
"Statement: On repeal of Wisconsins smoking ban
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)
Topic: public-health

Analysis: Studies by groups such as the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center said that air quality in state bars and restaurants had improved 92 percent since the ban took effect. And SmokeFree Wisconsin, a group that supported the ban, said 75 percent of state residents support the ban. So, Walker started out opposed to the ban, even toughening his stance to promise a repeal. But now hes opposed to a repeal, so the ban will remain."
"Statement: Ninety percent of Texans say they do not want the nursing homes to close. It polls higher than anything else.
Speaker: sylvester-turner (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,housing,state-budget

Analysis: Henson told us this poll and the UT/Tribunes poll are the only statewide surveys that hes aware of that cover budget cuts. Our results: The UT/Tribune poll found that 90 percent of respondents didnt want state funding for nursing home care cut, and opposition to that idea polled ""higher than anything else,"" as Turner said. Though he erred when he couched that as opposition to closing nursing homes  the poll didnt ask about that  its reasonable to assume that a comparable percentage of respondents would feel negatively about closures as well. But gauging the strength of statewide public opinion on the basis of a single, online poll of 800 voters is a questionable proposition."
"Statement: For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list so persons with unique abilities can get the help they need.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: disability,state-budget

Analysis: Scott said, ""For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list"" for people with disabilities. Advocates said Scott has a point about working to help around 5,000 disabled Floridians get off a narrow waiting list, but he left out two pieces of important context. First, the critical needs waiting list is a category that Scotts administration came up with about three years ago, so its not as if he had any historical competition. The state offered services to everyone on the critical needs list in 2014 and 2015, and Scott wants to do it again this year. However, Scott omits that those on the critical needs list are a subset of the overall waiting list of about 20,000 people."
"Statement: Paul Ryan got his start in politics, as a young staffer just out of college, working for then-Congressman John Kasichs Budget Committee.
Speaker: chris-redfern (democrat party)

"Statement: Race to the Top grants require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding.
Speaker: david-jolly (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Jolly said Race to the Top grants ""require participating states to adopt the Common Core standards as a condition for receiving federal funding. ""Adopting education guidelines  Common Core or otherwise  was an element of a states overall application score and would add to point totals. Common Core critics have since accused Washington of coercing states. But there was no concrete requirement to adopt standards in exchange for grant money. Experts told us the promise of federal money during the recession may have spurred Common Core adoption in some places, but theres no way to know that for sure."
"Statement: President Obama in November of last year wiped away (a program) that allows for shared fingerprinting for those who are behind bars so you know who is here legally and illegally.
Speaker: harris-faulkner (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: Faulkner said that Obama ended Secure Communities, a program that used fingerprint sharing to identify people in the country illegally. She is correct that Obama ended that program, but outside experts and ICE itself told us that the process of sharing fingerprints and identifying people who are not supposed to be in America continues. What ended was the deportation process that was at the center of Secure Communities. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out a lot of important information. Correction:Kathryn Steinle, the woman slain in San Francisco was in town to visit asister-in-law who was expecting."
"Statement: McCain sought the political support of minister John Hagee, ""who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'""
Speaker: moveon (democrat party)
Topic: religion

Analysis: (Listen to the     audio here    . )McCain said Hagee's comments were ""deeply offensive and indefensible,"" and ""I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee's endorsement, and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well. ""Hagee, meanwhile, issued a statement saying that he was withdrawing his endorsement and that critics were distorting his views. ""I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues,"" Hagee said on May 22, 2008."
"Statement: Says 51 percent of federal tax filers paid zero federal income tax.
Speaker: rob-cornilles (republican party)

Analysis: Just as Cornyn did from the Senate floor last summer, Cornilles was clear and precise that his reference to 51 percent not paying taxes relates to 2009."
"Statement: Because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, the stock market lost 2,000 points.
Speaker: charles-schumer (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: Our rating Schumer said that because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, ""the stock market lost 2,000 points. ""If you count the aftermath of the deal that avoided a debt ceiling breach, which included a historic downgrade of the United States creditworthiness rating, then Schumer is right that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. Still, Schumer makes it sound as if the drop happened right away. Actually, it dropped at the time of fight and continued to drop for another two months after the United States' credit rating was downgraded."
"Statement: Since Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took office, we are losing jobs at rates not seen in decades.
Speaker: kathleen-falk (democrat party)
Topic: job-accomplishments,jobs

Analysis: Overall, the state has seen a net gain in jobs since Walker took office. And in the months when jobs have declined under Walker, we have to go back only two years to find job losses at a greater rate."
"Statement: Says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin supports a tax increase that President Obama says would cost middle-class families $3,000 per year.
Speaker: tommy-thompson (republican party)
Topic: congress,families,message-machine-2012,taxes

Analysis: Our rating    Thompson said Baldwin supports a ""tax increase that President Obama says"" would cost families $3,000 per year. Baldwin did vote no on a law that prevented middle class taxes from increasing by $3,000. But she supported extending tax cuts for the middle class and she voted for a another measure, which failed, that also would have prevented the $3,000 middle-class tax hike."
"Statement: I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years.
Speaker: steve-lonegan (republican party)
Topic: congress,elections

Analysis: Lonegan said during a radio interview, ""I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years. ""In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U. S.  Senate to serve a fourth term, but he lost a Republican primary re-election bid in 1978, to Jeffrey Bell. Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. Republicans from New Jersey served in the Senate for eight months during 1982, and since mid-June, but both wereappointed, not elected. To comment on this story, go to NJ. com."
"Statement: Wisconsins attorney general and state treasurer ordered the daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson not to discuss climate change on state time.
Speaker: next-generation-climate-action-committee (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change

Analysis: We contacted Nelson and she declined to discuss the boards action -- or climate change. She did note she was going to be on vacation April 22, which is Earth Day, giving a talk about her father at his alma mater, San Jose State University. Our rating The advocacy group NextGen Climate says Nelson, daughter of the founder of Earth Day, is under orders not to discuss global warming on state time. Thats indeed the wording of the resolution approved 2-1 by the agencys board."
"Statement: Says unions take away hard-earned money of teachers, firefighters and police officers to play politics.
Speaker: florida-chamber-commerce (none party)
Topic: unions

Analysis: Whether it be the Public Broadcasting System, the United Way, or even the chamber, people donate or contribute money to be pooled with other donations so that the organizations or candidates can spread a message. If the contributor doesn't like that message, they stop giving. Union membership -- and as a result, the contributions that members make -- is voluntary. No group takes money away from union members."
"Statement: President Bush never did one interview with the New York Times during his entire presidency.
Speaker: rachel-maddow (none party)
Topic: bush-administration,pundits,transparency

Analysis: To be clear, we're not checking Maddow's broader point that Bush played favorites with the press. Is there any president who hasn't?Rather, we're checking Maddow's statement that President Bush ""never did one interview with the  New York Times  during his entire presidency."
"Statement: 14,000 Americans . . . lose their health insurance every single day.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: If these new subsidies end up boosting the use of COBRA  the data hasn't been compiled yet  then it could reduce the number of newly uninsured Americans from the levels that Holahan had predicted and that Obama cited. Obama was very close to Holohan's calculations  in fact he was slightly low. But as Haislmaier pointed out, the stimulus COBRA provisions could reduce the numbers because more people will still be covered. We can't be sure until the data is in."
"Statement: Mr. Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we dont have any donors.
Speaker: corey-lewandowski (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance

Analysis: ""Mr.  Trump is self-financing his campaign, so we dont have any donors,"" Lewandowski, Trumps campaign manager, told a Virginia radio audience. Trump is certainly his own greatest benefactor, having endowed his campaign with $12. 8 million of the $19. 4 million it raised through the end of last year - or 66 percent of its funds. Trump lists almost all of his investments in his campaign as a loan, not a donation, so he may be expecting to get some of his money back. He ignores thousands of supporters who contributed $6. 6 million through the end of last year, or 34 percent of the campaigns resources."
"Statement: Nearly 2,000 high schools - roughly 12 percent of all secondary schools in the United States - produce about half of the nations dropouts.
Speaker: bobby-scott (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: To sum up:    Scott said that nearly 2,000 high schools, about 12 percent of those in the U. S. , produce half the nations dropouts. He accurately cited a report based on 2006 data. An updated study found the number of low-performing schools dropped to 1,634 in 2009. That does not diminish Scotts point that a small percentage of high schools have an enormous impact on the nations dropout problem."
"Statement: Embryonic stem cell research is at a dead end, with no one good example of a successful treatment.
Speaker: dave-weldon (republican party)
Topic: health-care,message-machine-2012,science

Analysis: Weldons synopsis of embryonic stem cell research as at a scientific ""dead end"" does not appear to be widely shared by scientists. Research is ongoing, and scientists say its too early to call it quits on a discovery made in 1998. Weldons second point about there being ""no one good successful treatment"" from embryonic stem cell research is accurate, though scientists say it is premature and unrealistic given the fields bureaucratic constraints."
"Statement: The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined.
Speaker: anissa-naouai (none party)
Topic: federal-budget,military

Analysis: Naouai said, ""The U. S.  spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. ""The United States is definitely No. 1 on the worlds defense spending list. While we don't think viewers would get a markedly different impression if Naouai had said 8 or 12 instead of 16, her figures are off by a significant-enough margin."
"Statement: Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, thats hand counting the votes in the 2016 presidential recount.
Speaker: sean-duffy (republican party)
Topic: county-government,elections

Analysis: But many counties decided to do the recount by hand. The ""slow walking"" part of what Duffy said has to do with Stein and Clinton supporters and nothing to do with Dane County. Our rating Duffy said Wisconsin has only one county, Dane, ""that's hand counting the votes"" in the 2016 presidential recount. But several dozen counties committed to doing recounts by hand, Dane being one of them."
"Statement: Says Libya Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help in Benghazi.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,government-efficiency,history,terrorism

Analysis: Trump said ""Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. ""There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence."
"Statement: The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down.
Speaker: nancy-pelosi (democrat party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Pelosi said ""the Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down. ""But its the rate of growth thats dropped, not the actual cost of care  which is still rising. Meanwhile, recent studies agree that something more than just the recent recession has driven that lower growth rate. Some experts argue that includes provisions of the health care law, such as lower Medicare Advantage payments and incentives for greater efficiency from hospitals. Others say it's simply too soon to say. Spending may increase as more people become insured, but for now, there's divided support for Pelosi's statement."
"Statement: Tens of thousands of Atlanta households pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent.
Speaker: matthew-charles-cardinale (none party)
Topic: housing

Analysis: They do, whether looking at the citys housing strategy plan or the 2012 U. S.  Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse. Atlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data."
"Statement: Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner.
Speaker: karl-rove (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,elections

Analysis: ' According to a  2003 Rove profile published in Texas Monthly magazine, Rove and Weeks  persuaded Perry, an obscure Democratic legislator from Haskell who had  co-chaired Al Gore's 1988 Democratic presidential primary campaign in  Texas, to switch parties for the election. West Texas was swinging  Republican anyway, and Perry, who was discouraged by his failure to  advance in the House leadership and thinking of becoming a lobbyist, had  nothing to lose. The rest is dramatic Republican history:  Perry, whose advisers included Rove, upset Hightower and has now held  statewide office for nearly 20 years. Rove went on to help Bush to the  White House. Others were involved, though, in Perry making his  initial leap."
"Statement: As the usage [of synthetic marijuana] has dramatically increased, instances of violence, bodily harm and even death have risen with it.
Speaker: nathan-deal (republican party)

Analysis: The link between the drug and violence is less clear. News accounts suggest there is an increase in both, but we found so few cases its hard to tell. Deals statement could use clarification."
"Statement: Out of 150,000 tenured teachers in the last 10 years, only 17 have been dismissed for incompetence.
Speaker: chris-christie (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: But state records back up his statement about the 17 cases involving inefficiency or incompetence charges. Still, his underlying point is largely correct. The state has tens of thousands of teachers and only 17 have lost their jobs through dismissals or resignations in the past decade following charges of incompetence or inefficiency."
"Statement: The Providence teacher contract is one of the longest in the country.
Speaker: angel-taveras (democrat party)
Topic: education,labor,unions

Analysis: As both sides keep adding to an agreement, ""there are probably provisions that conflict with one another"" and there are probably more cases in which the school committee has given up some of its management rights to the union. In any event, it seems clear that Providence's teachers' contract is far from one of the longest in the nation, and Taveras' office was quick to say that the mayor misspoke. If he had said it was one of the longest in Rhode Island, we would give him a True."
"Statement: In 1929, the Secretary of State shut down a program that was collecting information to protect America because it was unseemly, but that move led to millions and millions of deaths in World War II.
Speaker: mike-rogers (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,history

Analysis: Rogers said that in 1929, the Secretary of State shut down a program that was ""collecting information to protect America"" because it was ""unseemly,"" but that move led to ""millions and millions"" of deaths in World War II. He is generally correct in his description of that years shuttering of a pioneering codebreaking project called the Black Chamber, but historians dismiss any suggestion that the program led inexorably to the onset of World War II. At best, they say, that notion is greatly exaggerated."
"Statement: Look at the debt that has been accumulated in the last two years. Its more debt under this president than all those other presidents combined.
Speaker: sarah-palin (republican party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget,history

Analysis: But Palin didnt say that. She said, quite specifically, that Obama had accumulated more debt in two years than the previous 43 presidents had collectively. And while Obama (along with Congress) has indeed accumulated a lot of debt for various reasons, his two-year debt total, even if you use the most generous standards for judging Palins comment, is still $3 trillion to $7 trillion short of the amount needed to make Palins statement accurate."
"Statement: The Chris Hani Baragwanath in South Africa is the worlds third-biggest hospital.
Speaker: chris-hani-baragwanath-hospital (none party)

Analysis: Administrators of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, said theirs is the third-largest in the world. Today, the hospital has 2,888 useable beds. A hospital in Belgrade, Serbia, has 3,470. The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is large, but not as large as it believes."
"Statement: Annual precipitation has increased in Rhode Island by over 12 inches in the last century.
Speaker: david-cicilline (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change,history,science,weather

Analysis: Reliable but slightly out-of-date sources back him up. The 100-year increase we calculated going through 2014 is just a tenth of an inch shy of 12 inches, but the difference between that and being slightly over 12 inches is just a few drops in the bucket."
"Statement: Says Connie Mack initially said he would have voted yes for the Paul Ryan budget plan, and then, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes.
Speaker: bill-nelson (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,federal-budget

Analysis: Nelson said of the second Ryan plan, ""You were asked would you support it, since you missed it. And then in a later interview, you said it was stupid and you would vote no. And then your folks corrected you, and you changed your position again, yes. ""If we start the timeline of Macks statements after he missed the vote March 29, we found Macks campaign said he would have voted yes, then he said it was a ""joke"", then his campaign said he meant the process was a joke and he would have voted yes. Then we find from late April through August Mack said a few times that he probably would have voted against it. But there was some consistency in Macks message: He criticized the Ryan plan for taking too long to balance the budget and promoted his faster-acting Penny Plan instead. Nelson omitted this part of Macks message. We didnt find any time that Mack called the Ryan plan ""stupid,"" but he did call it a ""joke,"" which is similar. Nelson is right that Mack kept changing his message about how he would have voted. But he omitted that Mack was consistent in arguing that the Ryan plan moves too slowly to balance the budget."

"Statement: Ohio is not meeting its obligation to update voter registrations when voters change their address with the BMV.
Speaker: kathleen-clyde (democrat party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Despite an increase overall in transactions, the Ohio rate has declined. The secretary of state, Ohios chief elections official, cited the low and declining rate in requesting a better level of compliance with the 1993 voting act. Ohio, clearly in some cases, is using address updates to its driver license database to update voter registration addresses. But considering that the states rate is less than half the national avearge, and that the option isnt even available for online transactions, the BMV is falling short of compliance with the nearly 20-year-old Motor Voter Act."

"Statement: The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly) is the DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women.
Speaker: centre-research-globalization (none party)
Topic: public-health

Analysis: An online article on the website ofthe Centre for Research of Globalizationsaid the DTaP vaccine is the mostly likely cause of microcephaly in Brazil. First of all, Brazil used Tdap, a slightly different version of the vaccine. Many thousands of pregnant women in the United States and around the world have been getting this vaccine for at least five years and multiple studies have found no ill effects on their babies. Not a single study has raised a red flag for any birth defect and certainly not microcephaly. In addition, administering the vaccine later in pregnancy reduces the likelihood that it will interfere with fetal development."
"Statement: Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening).
Speaker: gene-sperling (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs,labor

Analysis: Sperling said that in todays economy, there are three people looking for work per job available. We crunched BLS numbers and got the same ratio, as did economists. The BLS data has shortcomings, some that would make the ratio higher and some that would make it lower. It also might not accurately reflect what the climate looks like from the perspective of employers or job seekers. Still, these are minor quibbles."
"Statement: Says she got unions to agree to about $10 million in reduction of salaries and health benefits while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin.
Speaker: kathleen-falk (democrat party)
Topic: county-budget,county-government,labor,unions

Analysis: But they didnt dispute the fact that her agreements with the unions saved about $10 million. Our conclusion    Falk said she used collective bargaining to reduce Dane County employee salaries and health benefits by ""about $10 million. ""The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain. What is known is that the deals have saved the county more than $10 million in salaries and health benefit costs."
"Statement: Democrats have lost more than 900 state legislators since Barack Obama has been president.
Speaker: cokie-roberts (journalist party)

Analysis: Roberts said Obama sought to inspire Democrats across the country in his State of the Union address in part because the party lost ""more than 900 state legislators"" since he took office. Using data from the National Conference of State Legislatures, Democrats have lost 910 seats in statehouses across the country since 2009."
"Statement: Carly Fiorina, shes against banning assault weapons.
Speaker: barbara-boxer (democrat party)
Topic: guns,message-machine

Analysis: The NRA said it endorses her because she ""opposes re-enacting the Clinton gun and magazine ban. ""In ruling on the statement ""Carly Fiorina, she's against banning assault weapons,"" we find it compelling that she opposed the 1994 ban and thatthe NRA said she told them she would oppose re-enacting it. Is it possible some sort of new compromise bill might win Fiorina's support?It's possible, but there's little to indicate that's likely."
"Statement: Hillary's baby bond proposal would give $5,000 to each of the 4-million babies born in the U.S. each year, totaling $20-billion per year, multiplied by four years = $80-billion.

Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Clinton, at one point in 2007, talked about offering every newborn child born a $5,000 bond as part of an effort to encourage savings for such things as college tuition. The estimated cost would be $80-billion over four years. The RNC included the proposal in its Spend-O-Meter."
"Statement: Says her campaign platform includes the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: economy,education,energy,federal-budget,income,infrastructure,jobs,technology

Analysis: Clinton says her campaign platform includes the ""biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. ""Using rough estimates of public investment in several sectors, the size of Clintons proposals  at least $900 billion over 10 years  appears larger than any other 10-year investment since World War II. Its worth keeping in mind, though, that when we look at the size of the historical public investmentsas a share of GDP, there have been 12 years since World War II with larger public investments. In terms of whether these investments will result in ""new, good-paying jobs,"" thats all a matter of prediction. Rather, much of the money will go to programs that the Clinton campaign argues will spur job creation."
"Statement: Joe Biden brought Republicans and Democrats together to pass the 1994 crime bill, putting 100,000 cops on the streets and starting an eight-year drop in crime across the country.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: crime

Analysis: Obama's language is a little more tempered than Biden's. David Muhlhausen, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, notes that the beginning of the decline in violent crime actually started a bit before the funding for COPS kicked in. But stats show it's pretty close."
"Statement: If Rhode Island does a hybrid [retirement] plan well be the first state in the nation to do this.
Speaker: lincoln-chafee (democrat party)
Topic: pensions,public-service,retirement,workers

"Statement: Before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya.

Analysis: Our rating Johnson said that before the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, ""the State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya. ""State Department headquarters in Washington did refuse repeated requests from its ambassador in Libya for more security personnel. And it decided not to accept an offer from the Defense Department to extend the stay of one of its security units in Libya, reducing the level of security that was available."
"Statement: Failure to raise the debt limit does not force a U.S. default on debt payments.
Speaker: randy-forbes (republican party)

"Statement: Says Donald Trump has defended World War II internment camps.
Speaker: joaquin-castro (democrat party)
Topic: history

Analysis: Castro said Trump has defended World War II internment camps. Trump likened his proposed Muslim ban to how Roosevelt handled World War II. When pressed by journalists if he supported the internment camps for Japanese Americans under Roosevelts order, Trump said he was not praising that exactly. In another interview, Trump said he hates the ""concept"" of internment camps, but ""would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer"" on whether he supported or opposed Roosevelts action. Sometimes he declined to defend them, other times he has said he would have had to be present when the internment camps were in use."
"Statement: Bill McCollum holds the same position on (embryonic stem cell research) as Barack Obama.
Speaker: rick-scott (republican party)
Topic: abortion,science

Analysis: McCollum does, too. The only real question is regarding funding. McCollum did vote for the Dickey Amendment, which sought to prevent federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. But in 2004, he talked about ""appropriate funding"" for embryonic stem cell research. Obama, meanwhile, has supported increased federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, saying embryonic stem cells ""may have the potential to help us understand, and possibly cure, some of our most devastating diseases and conditions. ""There's enough of a question when it comes to funding in our minds to add a slight asterisk to Scott's mailer."
"Statement: In 1999, the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for (expanded background checks.)
Speaker: joe-manchin (democrat party)
Topic: guns

Analysis: Manchin explained his continued pursuit of expanding background checks, saying that in 1999, even ""the NRA leadership in Washington, pretty much the same people intact, were for this. ""Hes correct that LaPierre, at the center of the most recent gun legislation battle, testified before lawmakers that the NRA supported ""mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale. ""But then, as now, the group was opposed to specific legislative measures behind implementation of expanded checks. Even Manchins compromise measure may not have passed muster with 1999s NRA. Hes right that the leadership expressed support for expanding background checks generally, but the details get more complicated, especially in the context of specific legislation."
"Statement: Turkey is an Arab country.
Speaker: markos-moulitsas (none party)

Analysis: The one thing that Turkey has in common with the Arab world is religion: An estimated 99. 8 percent of the Turkish population is Muslim. ""But everything moves so fast that everything had moved on before I could say, 'Boy that was dumb -- I meant 'predominantly Muslim country.

"Statement: The number of people in Atlanta dying from HIV and AIDS declined 59 percent between 2004 and 2012.
Speaker: fulton-county-health-and-wellness (none party)
Topic: public-health

Analysis: At a time when new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are down globally, Fulton County touted a report that showed its mortality rate dropped 59 percent from a peak in 2004. The report, and state data, back up the dramatic decline. While Atlanta remains in the top five cities in the nation for such deaths and still struggles with executing prevention programs, it also has seen the mortality rate drop since the report."
"Statement: Says Lee Leffingwell raised property taxes 20 percent in three years.
Speaker: brigid-shea (democrat party)
Topic: city-budget,city-government,taxes

Analysis: Adjusted for inflation, that figure drops somewhat, but is still about 20 percent. So, taxes went up 20 percent, or more, with Leffingwell as mayor. However, no Austin mayor can raise taxes solo commando. Leffingwell had one of the seven votes that were cast each year in setting the citys rates."
"Statement: Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: homeland-security,military,terrorism

Analysis: A few of the sentiments have some link to reality  Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications."
"Statement: 8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Many of the Democratic losses came in the 1994 election cycle, when voters dealt a stunning rebuke to Clinton's first-term policies and put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. But the GOP began to lose congressional seats in the 1996 and 1998 elections, while Clinton still was in office. And just months after he departed, the Senate shifted back to Democratic control after Vermont Sen.  Jim Jeffords switched his affiliation from Republican to Independent."
"Statement: 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obamas first term belonged to women.
Speaker: carly-fiorina (republican party)
Topic: jobs,women

Analysis: Fiorina said 92 percent of the jobs lost during Obamas first term belonged to women. By January 2013, the jobs numbers dont back it up at all. The number of women with jobs increased by 416,000 during Obamas first term."
"Statement: Says President Barack Obama was responsible for the assassination of at least four American citizens in drone strikes.
Speaker: kesha-rogers (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy,legal-issues,terrorism

Analysis: Rogers said Obama was responsible for ""the assassination of at least four American citizens"" in drone strikes. U. S.  drone strikes reportedly carried out on Obamas authority killed the citizens listed by Rogers. But three deaths were evidently not intended, while its debated -- and unsettled at best -- whether the killing of al-Awlaki, targeted for his al-Qaeda role, was an assassination."
"Statement: It used to be the policy of the Republican Party to get rid of the Department of Education. We finally get in charge and a chance to do something, so we double the size of the Department of Education.
Speaker: ron-paul (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Student loans make up the bulk of the mandatory spending, meaning that federal law compels the department to cover the cost of guaranteeing and directly making loans to students no matter how the cost fluctuates due to interest rates or the number of student applications. Most other programs  including No Child Left Behind funding  are considered discretionary, meaning the amounts get decided each year. But whether the spending is mandatory or discretionary, Paul, a libertarian who does not believe the federal government has a role to play in education policy, says it's better left to the states. Many of his Republican colleagues, as evidenced by the $73-billion increase in funding the Education Department enjoyed while they controlled Congress and the White House, apparently do not agree."
"Statement: We have 395 inmates pushed into triple-bunked cells intended for two inmates and bunked in classrooms and areas supposed to be designated for inmate labor.
Speaker: ken-allen (democrat party)
Topic: public-safety,state-budget,unions

Analysis: The closure of Santiam would have prompted more conversions. There may be more teaching and work space converted to housing in the future. And a handful of beds -- 24 -- were added to rooms that typically house two inmates. But none of those reasons mitigate the fact that those 395 beds are not located in work areas, and the small number of third and fourth beds are not in cells designed to hold only two people."
"Statement: The ACLU didnt call for an investigation (of the Newark police department), they called for an immediate federal monitor.
Speaker: cory-booker (democrat party)
Topic: crime,ethics

Analysis: He declined to comment to PolitiFact New Jersey, according to spokeswoman Anne Torres. To review: The mayor tried to downplay the controversy by saying the ACLU called for a federal monitor of the Newark Police Department instead of requesting an investigation. Yet the first sentence of the ACLUs petition to the Department of Justice requests an investigation."
"Statement: Says his executive order requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV wasnt mandatory.
Speaker: rick-perry (republican party)
Topic: families,health-care

Analysis: Just because there's a loophole  a way to ""say no,"" in the governor's parlance  doesn't mean the requirement doesn't exist. Physical education classes are also mandatory to graduate high school, but if you have any number of health conditions, you can skip the timed mile."
"Statement: Says a highway was closed in El Paso because of bullets flying across the border.
Speaker: greg-abbott (republican party)
Topic: crime,drugs,homeland-security

Analysis: According to an Aug.  31 story on the Times' website, U. S.  Rep.  Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, said he and Obama talked about the ""rollercoaster violence along the border"" and about the bullets that hit El Paso City Hall and UTEP during the ride to Texas on Air Force One. So, where does that leave Abbott's statement?Gunfire in Mexico did spur El Paso authorities to close a section of U. S.  85, an action that a police spokesman said was unprecedented. One bullet was found in a Texas university building, and other reports, though unconfirmed as yet, indicate more ""bullets were flying across the border,"" as Abbott said."
"Statement: If the House of Representatives fails to extend the middle-class tax cuts, 400,000 middle-class Rhode Island families will see their federal income taxes increase.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)

Analysis: But saying that the number of middle-class Rhode Island families to be affected is 400,000 is a substantial exaggeration. (With staff reports from Paul Edward Parker and Philip Marcelo."
"Statement: 95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent.
Speaker: neera-tanden (newsmaker party)
Topic: income,jobs

Analysis: Tanden said that 95 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. Tanden accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Tanden said and depend on how you define income. Tandens statement is accurate but in need of clarification."

The ruling Todd said, ""Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate. ""Though theres some deviation in the number of competitive states, nine seems like a pretty safe bet, and the number reported by a good portion of news sources. As for the share of Hispanic voting population, Todd is right on the money."
"Statement: We didnt go out and take information from the Hillary Clinton campaign.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Sanders said that his campaign did not go out and take information from the Clinton campaign. The Sanders people stumbled upon a glitch. But rather than reporting the glitch immediately, they probed the database for a bit under two hours. At some point, the staff produced a page of information that at the very least would show the count of certain voters. Experts familiar with the Democratic voter data base say that the Sanders campaign would have gleaned valuable information. At the end of the day, they knew some things about the Clinton campaign that they hadnt known before, even if they didnt seek to crack into the Clinton data."
"Statement: If you actually took the number of Muslims [sic] Americans, we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: religion

Analysis: So Obama is trying to make a point that the United States is in touch with the Muslim world because it has a substantial Muslim population. But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60."
"Statement: On the pace that we're on with job creation in the last four months ...we will have created more jobs in this year than in the entire Bush Presidency.
Speaker: debbie-wasserman-schultz (democrat party)
Topic: bush-administration,economy

Analysis: Later, he called the comparison Wasserman Schultz was attempting to make ""dubious,"" but literally accurate. None of that factors in that more than 400,000 of the new jobs are temporary jobs created to complete the 2010 U. S.  Census. Wasserman Schultz gets her numbers right in saying that the U. S.  in 2010 is on a pace to add more jobs to the economy than during the eight years George W.  Bush was president. In fact, you can take the same statistics and reach an entirely different point. Not that we recommend that."
"Statement: Says Nikita Khrushchev brought an extra shoe to a United Nations session in 1960, which he banged on the desk in protest.

Analysis: Commentator Arthur Cyr stated that Nikita Khrushchev brought an extra shoe to a United Nations session, which he used to bang on the desk in protest in 1960. ""And now, more than two decades later, he can't remember who told him. Meanwhile, the New York Times account from that era states that Khrushchev took off his own shoe.

"Statement: Sen. Joe Liebermans home state has a public option which covers about 10,000 of its citizens that was introduced by its Republican governor.
Speaker: keith-olbermann (none party)
Topic: health-care,pundits

Analysis: The Charter Oak plan does not meet a strict definition of a public option. In fact, it bears some marks of a health insurance exchange, where private plans compete. On his other two points  that 10,000 people are enrolled and that it was introduced by a Republican governor  Olbermann is correct."
"Statement: Says this months special session will cost the state $27,300 a day just for legislators daily living expenses.

Analysis: But after the commission proposed authorizing the same rate members of the 2011 Legislature, Dewhurst and House Speaker Joe Straus called for the rate to be lowered to $150 in a Nov.  29, 2010 letter stating the move would help the state tighten overall spending. Do lawmakers ever pass up the per diem?Patsy Spaw, the Senate secretary, told us that no senators have declined the payments since 2003 when Senate Democrats fled to New Mexico to impede the passage of redistricting legislation.

"Statement: Says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas.
Speaker: bill-hammond (republican party)
Topic: state-budget,taxes

Analysis: Hammond said businesses pay roughly 60 percent of the states tax bill. By our calculations using state projections that do not take into account all taxes, businesses will pay 52 percent of taxes in the state in 2015. In contrast, Hammonds source, a national group representing corporations, calculates that businesses paid 61 percent of all taxes in Texas in fiscal 2011. So, estimates vary because different taxes are considered."

"Statement: Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had fast-track trade authority.
Speaker: paul-ryan (republican party)
Topic: congress,congressional-rules,foreign-policy,history,trade

Analysis: Ryan said, ""Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had"" fast-track trade authority. From the 1930s until today, Every president except Nixon (and Obama) has had the ability to negotiate aspects of foreign trade policy with limited congressional involvement. But these policies arent 100 percent apples to apples. For one, todays policy involves more congressional oversight than the policy in place through the 1960s. Additionally, the original policy only pertained to tariff reductions, while todays policy includes non-tariff barriers to trade. (Up until the late 1960s, foreign trade negotiations focused nearly exclusively on tariffs."

Analysis: Rubio said that the majority of Americans are conservative. Two of the three pollls show that while conservatives are a plurality, they are short of a majority. In the one poll that gives voters two choices -- liberal or conservative -- conservatives have consistently been the majority. By one, he was correct and we find support for his underlying point that there are more conservatives than liberals."

Analysis: A headline in the liberal blog Miscellany Blue declared, ""Lawmaker seeks to defund Planned Parenthood for cutting children into small pieces.  "" Groens proposal doesnt mention Planned Parenthood, but the effect of the bill would be to strip it, and other similar groups, of state funding. Meanwhile, Groen did make the statement about the group ""cutting children into small pieces"" four years ago, and hes made similar declarations recently."
"Statement: Obama has racked up more debt than any president in history over $5 trillion.
Speaker: jim-renacci (republican party)
Topic: deficit,economy,federal-budget

Analysis: Experts note, too, that the weak economy has contributed to the debt, given the reduction in federal revenues and greater spending on items like unemployment benefits. Renacci is accurate in asserting that the national debt has increased since Obama took office by more than $5 trillion, more than any previous administration. But his statement assigns direct control -- and blame -- to Obama. Lost in that is the impact of the faltering economy, decisions made before Obama took office and the fact that others, such as Congress, also have had a role in increasing the debt."

Analysis: A group that supports the governor released a video ad that said with Christie and bipartisan reformers, New Jersey had ""the most job growth in 11 years. ""The state gained more jobs overall last year than in seven years -- not 11 years. In 2004, the state added 37,700 jobs. In 2011, we added 36,400 jobs. Public-sector growth boosted job gains in 2004, while last year the state added jobs despite a decrease in government employment . The ad doesnt make a distinction in the types of jobs gained, but a spokesman said it was referring to private-sector employment.

Analysis: If you dont count Massachusetts system, we tie for the No. Even when 2012 rolls around and the rate drops to 9. 9 percent, Oregon will still rank as one of the highest -- second only to Hawaii (and, in some cases, Massachusetts)."
"Statement: The No. 1 issue that the American people care about is getting America back to work.
Speaker: john-cornyn (republican party)
Topic: economy,health-care

Analysis: Thirteen percent chose national security/terrorism and 13 percent said the deficit and government spending. So  the senator got it right. Americans consider jobs the No."

Speaker: rob-turner (republican party)
Topic: message-machine-2012,state-budget

Analysis: Turner says in a mailer that Storms ""voted to fund the Taj Mahal Courthouse. But there is some additional information we find missing from this attack. Namely, the courthouse money was inserted at the last minute into a larger bill without much explanation. The money, as far as most lawmakers knew, was to build a courthouse, not an opulent one. Once details of the Taj became known, Storms openly criticized the plan."
"Statement: In France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive than the United States.
Speaker: rand-paul (republican party)
Topic: homeland-security,terrorism

Analysis: Paul said that ""in France, they have a (surveillance) program a thousandfold more invasive"" than the United States.  "" The term ""a thousandfold"" is impossible to measure and is presumably a rhetorical flourish on Pauls part. Still, we found five notable areas in which the French system offers law enforcement and government officials more unfettered tools than American officials have the ability to use."
"Statement: One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,immigration,taxes

Analysis: Clinton said, ""One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays. ""While there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him. But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we dont know anything about Trumps current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trumps federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant."
"Statement: Last week the Blue Chip Economic Indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and positive growth in the fourth quarter.
Speaker: christina-romer (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: Very few economists predicted the current economic crisis. One who did, New York University professor and noted pessimist Nouriel Roubini (who is not a Blue Chip panelist),     said on March 9    that he saw ""no hope for the recession ending in 2009 and (it) will more than likely last into 2010. ""But Romer is entitled to highlight optimistic forecasts."
"Statement: Since the United States began negotiations with Iran, thats probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy,nuclear

Analysis: Obama said that we have seen ""probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade. ""The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. International observers report that Iran complied with the terms of the temporary agreement. The amount of enriched uranium is less, and the countrys facilities to produce weapons-grade material has been curtailed. There is also concern about broader aspects of a nuclear weapons program, such as weapons design and missile development."
"Statement: Says Ohios I-X Center used to be a great plant, but thousands of people of worked here, and they left when their jobs were moved overseas.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,jobs

Analysis: Trump said that Clevelands I-X center was an example of a once-great plant, but""thousands and thousands of people worked here, and they left. So many people are leaving, so many people are closing their businesses and moving to Mexico and other countries. ""Trumps lamentation of outsourcingisnt historically accurate. The I-X Center was alternately called the Cleveland Tank Plant, and GMs Cadillac and Allison Divisions built military bombers, tanks and personnel carriers there between 1942 and 1972. Production stopped when a military contract expired and was not renewed. Once acquired by the Park Corporation, it opened as an exhibition space in 1985 and has operated as one ever since."

Analysis: Texas has a huge border with Mexico. What does he anticipate the Guard doing?And those are the kinds of things that I think then I will transmit to the secretary of defense and the president in the ongoing decision about Guard  yes, no, and if so how many and where. ""Bottom line: The Obama administration has repeatedly acknowledged Perry's request for troops; it just hasn't given him the answer he seeks."
"Statement: Under a new law, doctors performing drug-induced abortions could be charged if women dont return to them for follow-up care
Speaker: wisconsin-medical-society (none party)
Topic: abortion,legal-issues,women

Analysis: Our conclusion    The president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients dont return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion. On that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return. There is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill."
"Statement: Says veterans disability claims backlog doubled in Obamas first term.
Speaker: john-cornyn (republican party)

"Statement: In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families.
Speaker: roy-cooper (democrat party)

Analysis: Cooper said that ""in 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. ""We find his tally of the tax increases to be correct, yet many of them will affect only small groups of people in any given year. And Cooper cherry-picks by leaving out the substantial reduction in the income tax rate, which applied broadly to people at all income levels, even though it did mostly help the wealthy."
"Statement: Romney adviser admits Romneycare was blueprint for Obamacare.

If voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit to www. votexas. org or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683.

Topic: elections

Analysis: Trump said, ""The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. ""The New York Times sent a letter to subscribers thanking them for their loyalty and promising to provide strong coverage of Trump going forward. While the letter does note that the New York Times underestimated support for Trump, it does not say their coverage of him throughout the campaign was bad. In fact, the letter praises New York Times reporters work. The note does not include any semblance of an apology."
"Statement: Some businesses in Oregon are having to shrink back their businesses as a result of the law.
Speaker: monica-wehby (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,health-care

Analysis: Because we cant assess motives, we chose to look more narrowly at whether businesses are or are not making cutbacks in response to the law, accepting that the overwhelming majority would be acting with their businesses bottom line in mind. Wehbys campaign provided an example of a significant scaling back of an Oregon-based business, though aspects could not be independently verified. She also gave us links to national news stories reporting similar cuts elsewhere. An Oregon consultant also outlined an example of a business trimming employee hours as a result of the law."
"Statement: Says 11 straight years of no major hurricanes striking land in the United States bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument.
Speaker: rush-limbaugh (none party)
Topic: climate-change

Analysis: Limbaugh said the fact that the United States went 11 straight years without major hurricanes ""just bores a hole right through the whole climate change argument. ""There are several major flaws in his line of reasoning. First, looking only at major hurricanes that hit the United States ignores storm activity around the world. Second, storm frequency does not strictly correlate with rising temperature. Third, many other data points prove that climate change is real."
"Statement: We spend more money on health care per capita in the United States than any other country in the world. Of the 30 developed countries in the world, we spend 2 1/2 times more than the average. Of the country that spends the second most per capita, Switzerland, we spend 175 percent more.
Speaker: david-dewhurst (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: PolitiFact. com in Washington covered similar ground in March when it rated True former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's statement that ""the lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less"" on health care. ""To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner,"" Romney said. Recap: As far as we can tell  and keeping in mind that Dewhurst didn't respond to our queries for backup  he was spot-on in saying the United States spends more money on health care per capita than the rest of the world, and he's right that we spend two-and-a-half times more than the average cost of all the OECD countries. He erred in his Switzerland comparison."
"Statement: I have 2 and a half million more votes than he (Sanders) does.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)

Analysis: Clinton said she hasreceived 2. 5 million more votes than Sanders. However, given the numbers we do have, it is likely that Clintons lead is at least in the neighborhood of 2. 4 million votes. Thats not much of a difference."
"Statement: On abortion

Topic: abortion,corrections-and-updates

Analysis: And it hit me hard at that very moment that the Roe v.  Wade philosophy had cheapened the value of human life. And I said to my chief of staff, who was with me in the meeting, as we came outside, I am no longer content with the description of my position. I want to call myself pro-life.  "" Our ruling       Romneys views on abortion are significantly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Indeed, Romney has acknowledged that his views on abortion have changed over the years."
"Statement: Members of Congress receive full pay retirement after serving one term.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)

"Statement: Says he worked with the Democratic legislature to balance spending with revenues so that at the end of my four-year term, the rainy day fund was established at more than $2 billion.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: economy,new-hampshire-2012,state-budget,state-finances

Analysis: The state's financial records back that up. But it's important to note that the spending reductions he touts occurred in just one year, 2003. And besides the spending reductions in that one year, Massachusetts also earned a revenue windfall from a surge in capital gains receipts."
"Statement: In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year.
Speaker: americans-united-life (organization party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 ""were reported to have died following attempted abortions. ""The figure is based on an ""other"" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems."

"Statement: Just about everyone everywhere is spending more hours on the job, less time with their families, bringing home smaller and smaller paychecks, while theyre paying more and more at the gas pump and the grocery stores.
Speaker: ed-fitzgerald (democrat party)
Topic: economy,income,jobs,labor,workers

Analysis: We did not assign credit to Kasich for his statement in March that Ohioans' wages have risen by more than $10 billion since 2010. But we rated the statement as True. We can't rate FitzGerald's linking of Kasich to his statement about people spending more hours on the job and bringing home smaller paychecks. But his statement is accurate, with the point of clarification that ""smaller paychecks"" are in inflation-adjusted current dollars."
"Statement: The hour of sleep you lose during the change to daylight saving time might initially pose some health risks.
Speaker: joel-keehn (none party)
Topic: science

Analysis: He made sure to point out the potential positives as well. Keehn cited one study to back up his positions, and there are others that do so as well. And while there is another study that shows how over the course of a year increased daylight prevents traffic accidents, these studies do not discount the temporary health effects caused by a sudden loss of sleep, nor do they attempt to. The blogger was precise in saying it was the loss of sleep that would cause health risks for a few days."
"Statement: David Perdue said hed raise taxes.
Speaker: jack-kingston (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Basing the statement alone on Perdues meeting with a newspaper editorial board takes his statements out of context. Equating revenue increases with tax hikes is a stretch that breaks upon closer examination. Perdue is far more clear, though, on support for extending sales taxes to goods and services bought online. Though the Fair Tax includes such a tax as part of its proposal, there is a separate bill that would levy the Internet sales tax in the exact way that Perdue said he supported."
"Statement: I am the first Latina to run for governor of Texas.
Speaker: miriam-martinez (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,diversity,elections,history

"Statement: Says Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers.
Speaker: mark-johnson (republican party)
Topic: Alcohol,economy

Analysis: Even if we exclude the two districts with McMenamins pubs, more than 90 percent of House and Senate districts in Oregon have at least one craft brewery. If Johnson had hedged his statement a bit and said that ""nearly"" every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery, this would be a True. But thats not what he said. Johnson said in his floor speech that every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery."
"Statement: Wisconsins criminal threshold for drunken-driving is way out of line with states surrounding us, which have the second offense as a felony.
Speaker: alberta-darling (republican party)
Topic: Alcohol,criminal-justice,state-budget,transportation

Analysis: In contrast to Wisconsin, where fourth offense can be a felony, four out of five of the states closest neighbors make it a felony faster than Wisconsin. But only one does so at the second offense as Darling said. Three put the threshold at third offense, and another puts it at fourth, as in Wisconsin."
"Statement: In Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget.
Speaker: ted-strickland (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: The natural impression left by the governors words ""we invested in our children, increasing school funding"" is that Ohios state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohios children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland."
"Statement: The poverty level in the Dallas school district is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark.
Speaker: dan-micciche (none party)
Topic: education,poverty

Analysis: Micciche said the poverty level in the Dallas school district ""is one of the highest in the country, higher than New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit and Newark. ""The poverty level is among the highest, though it looks like a greater share of Detroit students was living at or below poverty in 2010 and data collected by the federal government suggests that as of October 2010, the Dallas district was tied with the considerably smaller Newark district with nearly nine in 10 students eligible for free- or reduced-price meals. Then again, a more recent survey of school districts indicates Dallas had the greatest share of students qualified for the meal programs that year."

Speaker: joe-biden (democrat party)
Topic: economy,job-accomplishments

Analysis: ""It had gotten bad by (the time they came into office),"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D. C.  ""Regardless of political leanings, it is not ambiguous that Obama inherited a labor market in free fall. ""Our ruling:    The economic recovery and job creation during the Obama administration will be a leading point of contention throughout the 2012 election.

"Statement: In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, nobody got upset.

Analysis: Hannity said that in 2007, when Nancy Pelosi met with President Assad of Syria, ""nobody got upset. ""In reality, many politicians, pundits and editorial boards spoke out against Pelosis trip, including Bush and Cheney. Hannity told PolitiFact that he was referring specifically to comments made in support of Pelosis trip by Obama and Hillary Clinton.

"Statement: For the past eight years, Gov. Carcieri and Mrs. Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree.

Topic: religion

Analysis: Talk-radio host John DePetro stated, ""For the past eight years Gov. Carcieri and Mrs.  Carcieri would host the lighting of the State House Christmas tree"" -- emphasizing the words ""Christmas tree"" -- to criticize Chafee's reference to ""holiday tree. ""Certainly the Carcieri administration wasn't reluctant to use the term ""Christmas tree. ""But we found more than a few exceptions that used the term ""holiday tree"" -- just as Chafee has -- and the word ""Christmas"" was noticeably absent. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."
"Statement: Rhode Island has the the second-most heavily deployed National Guard in the United States.
Speaker: sheldon-whitehouse (democrat party)
Topic: afghanistan,iraq,military,states

Analysis: If the rates in other states increased in a similar fashion to Rhode Islands -- and theres no reason to believe they didnt -- then the rankings in 2007, in all likelihood, are the same today. Rhode Island then would still have the second-highest number of deployments per capita in the nation. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter."

Analysis: ""That is the opposite of how we are approaching the work. ""Our rating  A group opposing the ""turnaround"" program for MPS posted a photo of Demond Means with a statement that says ""MPS needs to be gutted. Indeed, the original words on the photo conveyed a message of helping public schools, not gutting them."
"Statement: SaysVirginia RepublicanScott Taylor has been convicted in at least four different courts across the country, at times failing to even appear, and having a warrant issued for his arrest.
Speaker: randy-forbes (republican party)
Topic: campaign-advertising

Analysis: A Forbes campaign brochure says, ""Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four courts across the country, at times failing to appear and having a warrant issued for his arrest. ""Taylor has been convicted in five courts. He was charged with failing to appear in court once, not multiple ""times"" as Forbes says. And there was one time, in 2004, when a bench warrant was issued for Taylors arrest. The problem is that Forbes, in setting up Taylor as lawbreaker, gives voters only half of the story. He contours language and images to suggest Taylor is no better than a criminal, but dodges actually saying so. Forbes doesnt mention that all of Taylors convictions concerned driving violations, mostly speeding. He doesnt mention that the failure-to-appear charge against Taylor was dropped later. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, says he missed the 2004 court date - triggering the arrest warrant - because he had been sent on a lengthy military training exercise. There are no angels in this fact check. Taylors driving record is fair game for criticism. Forbes attack is partially accurate but skips important details."
"Statement: Nearly 90% of Travis County government races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary.
Speaker: wayne-thorburn (republican party)
Topic: county-government,elections

Analysis: Thorburn said ""nearly 90 percent"" of the Travis County government races this year will be settled by the March Democratic primary, thanks to the paucity of Republicans who filed to run. His declared count was too high. Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over."

Speaker: todd-staples (republican party)
Topic: crime,immigration,state-budget,state-finances

Analysis: Staples said savings he achieved helped fund cameras on the border and that as a result, more than 21,500 arrests were made and 46 tons of narcotics were confiscated. Its documented that the grant money supported the border effort. But we dont see a way to tie particular arrests and confiscations to the grants. Also, this statement leaves out the critical fact that about 90 percent of the operations funding has come from federal aid awarded through the governors office."
"Statement: The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts (congressional) leadership and committee staff.
Speaker: tom-coburn (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: But the CRS report provides more wiggle room; it states ""it appears possible"" that the language could be interpreted that way. It would have been more accurate to say that the language ""may exempt"" some staffers. However, on two occasions, Coburn tried to fix the problem."
"Statement: Says the number of Americans living at or below the poverty line is at its highest level since 1964.
Speaker: barbara-buono (democrat party)
Topic: poverty

Analysis: The latest official poverty rate -- 15 percent in 2011 -- does represent one of the highest levels since 1964, but there have been a few years in the past five decades when the rate was the same or higher than the most current estimate."
"Statement: The IRS will have the ability potentially to deny or delay health care.
Speaker: michele-bachmann (republican party)
Topic: health-care,taxes

Analysis: Bachmann said ""the IRS will have the ability potentially"" to deny or delay health care. She makes it sound like the IRS would purposefully deny or delay people from getting health coverage, perhaps based on an applicants political beliefs. Experts told us that was extremely far-fetched. But if complicated logistical challenges are not met, there is a chance that IRS could inadvertently end up delaying some of the millions of uninsured Americans seeking subsidies from purchasing insurance on the exchanges."
"Statement: Deregulation of the states telecommunications industry will create 50,000 jobs in Wisconsin.
Speaker: rich-zipperer (republican party)

Analysis: Whats more, the study thats been tied to the telecom industry, which is seeking the deregulation. Even Zipperer and other backers admit they do not know how many jobs the new law will create, or how much money will actually be invested by telecom companies."
"Statement: We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: In a speech in Ohio, Trump said, ""We admit about 100,000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year. ""By a broad measure of which countries are part of the Middle East, Trump is close to the number of new green card holders during fiscal 2014, though the average from 2005 to 2014 was 88,088.

Analysis: But those who gather the numbers say they cant be used in the manner Miller is using them. (Its similar to an earlier fact-check, where Republicans were comparing the state job-growth numbers to the national ones. )Miller has the right number for the increase of unemployed people. But its impossible to know how many lost their jobs this year vs.  those who lost their jobs earlier and are now starting to look again."
"Statement: Says in the last 20 years, the French have not stood by the United States on foreign policy.
Speaker: rick-santorum (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,history,military

Analysis: Santorums mockery of Frances willingness to advance U. S.  foreign policy goals is misplaced. On a wide range of issues over two decades -- from the Persian Gulf War to the Balkans to Afghanistan to counter-terrorism to Iran sanctions -- France has worked diplomatically with the U. S.  and has repeatedly put its troops in harms way."
"Statement: For the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: job-accomplishments,taxes

Analysis: Every taxpayer is different, and some ""middle-class"" Americans may have seen their tax rate or their tax burden go up for one reason or another. But Obama was talking about ""the average middle-class family. ""The changes to the tax code made under Obama and the analyses by the Tax Policy Center show that for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution, both the average tax paid and the average tax rate fell between 2008 and 2011."
"Statement: There's more than 100,000 people working at the Department of Agriculture. That's 1 employee for every 30 farmers.
Speaker: george-lemieux (republican party)
Topic: agriculture,federal-budget

Analysis: The USDA currently employees about 105,000 people but that actually translates to 1 employee for every 11 or so farmers based on one calculation, not 1 in 30. That's strike one (though we should note that the correct ratio better makes LeMieux's point). But our point is that you should give that ratio little thought, because it appears to rely on an oversimplification of the USDA's mission. The USDA does a lot more than just deal with farmers, from managing the national forest system, to overseeing the school lunch and food stamp programs, to inspecting meat and poultry products heading to the grocery store."

Speaker: facebook-posts (none party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,economy,federal-budget,history,stimulus

Analysis: Obama has indeed presided over the slowest growth in spending of any president using raw dollars, and it was the second-slowest if you adjust for inflation. The math simultaneously backs up Nuttings calculations and demolishes Romneys contention. The only significant shortcoming of the graphic is that it fails to note that some of the restraint in spending was fueled by demands from congressional Republicans. The Fact Checker addressed the apparent discrepancy succinctly in a follow-up column, saying ""we did not evaluate the same thing. ""After our original fact-check published, White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted, ""PolitiFact backs MarketWatch analysis of federal spending under POTUS & predecessors. ""Many conservative bloggers read our fact-check the same way, as they attacked us. The Facebook post does rely partly on Nuttings work, and our item addresses that, but we did not simply give our seal of approval to everything Nutting wrote. Using and slightly tweaking Nuttings methodology, we recalculated spending increases under each president back to Dwight Eisenhower and produced tables ranking the presidents from highest spenders to lowest spenders. By contrast, both the Fact Checker and the AP zeroed in on one narrower (and admittedly crucial) data point -- how to divide the responsibility between George W.  Bush and Obama for the spending that occurred in fiscal year 2009, when spending rose fastest. How you divide the spending between Bush and Obama for fiscal 2009 only makes a difference to our ruling if the shifts move Obama significantly up or down our rankings. Nutting attributed spending from the first year of every presidential term to the previous administration, arguing that every new president starts their term four months into a fiscal year begun under their predecessor. Historically, this has not been a particularly controversial approach, and even some of Nuttings critics we spoke to agreed that its not a bad rule of thumb. But fiscal year 2009 was special because it came amid an economic and financial free fall that drove the nations leaders to spend a lot more than they ordinarily would. Nutting did take these factors into account, but not to the extent that some critics think is needed. He also shifted excess spending beyond what Bush would have spent from the appropriations bills signed by Obama in 2009. A number of critics also argued that spending for the Troubled Asset Relief Program should be taken into account. This program aided troubled financial institutions and involved a lot of money going out the door in fiscal 2009 and a lot of money coming in the door in subsequent years as the money was paid back to the treasury. The critics note that counting the TARP expenses as Bushs artificially raises the baseline level of spending Obama inherited, thereby making Obamas subsequent spending increases seem unrealistically small. We think reasonable people can disagree on which president should be responsible for TARP spending, but to give the critics their say, well include it in our alternative calculation. So, combining the fiscal 2009 costs for programs that are either clearly or arguably Obamas -- the stimulus, the CHIP expansion, the incremental increase in appropriations over Bushs level and TARP -- produces a shift from Bush to Obama of between $307 billion and $456 billion, based on the most reasonable estimates weve seen critics offer. Thats quite a bit larger than Nuttings $140 billion, but by our calculations, it would only raise Obamas average annual spending increase from 1. 4 percent to somewhere between 3. 4 percent and 4. 9 percent. That would place Obama either second from the bottom or third from the bottom out of the 10 presidents we rated, rather than last. Our extensive consultations with budget analysts since our item was published convinces us that theres no single ""correct"" way to divvy up fiscal 2009 spending, only a variety of plausible calculations. Even using the higher of the alternative measurements, at least seven presidents had a higher average annual increases in spending."
"Statement: Says President Barack Obama promised a pathway to citizenship to undocumented immigrants and didnt deliver jack squat on any of it.
Speaker: reince-priebus (republican party)
Topic: children,families,homeland-security,immigration

Analysis: And Zepecki cited Obama's executive order. Our rating   Priebus said Obama promised a ""pathway to citizenship"" to immigrants ""and he didn't deliver jack squat on any of it. ""Obama has not delivered the pathway to citizenship, although Priebus does not make it clear that Obamas effort -- the DREAM Act -- was blocked by Republicans.

"Statement: California has robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation.
Speaker: kevin-de-leon (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change,economy,energy,jobs

Analysis: State Senator Kevin de Len said earlier this month that California has ""robust job growth that outpaces the rest of the nation, all while reducing carbon emissions and cleaning up the air we breathe. ""We limited our fact check to whether California has grown jobs faster than ""the rest of the nation. ""We did not evaluate the impact the states clean energy policies have had on job growth, a question raised by the second part of De Lens statement. Economists we spoke with agree that Californias job growth rate has been higher than the nations overall average  for several years. Last year, the states job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the countrys. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state thats added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat. And there is another way to read the senators statement. One could assume the senator meant Californias job growth rate outpaced all other individual states. Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of ""the rest of the nation,"" and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success."
"Statement: The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household.

Analysis: The current gross debt is $12. 3 trillion. Presto, chango, carry the one, move the decimal point . . . and you get two different debt per household figures. The household share of the debt owed by the public is about $67,000. The household share of the gross federal debt is slightly more than $106,000. McDonnell's press secretary, Stacey Johnson, did not return two phone calls or an e-mail asking for clarification on what debt figures the governor was using to make his calculations. Or he's mixing one form of debt to make one point, and another to make a second. In his State of the Union response, McDonnell tried using both the macro and the micro to drive home a point that spending led by the Democrats in the White House and Congress is out of control."

Cuellar correctly characterizes the law. The law was passed as a measure to combat human trafficking worldwide. As a result, certain parts of the legislation allow unaccompanied minors from noncontiguous countries to stay in the United States. Lawmakers are now contemplating changing the law."

"Statement: The law is very clear! 'The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.'
Speaker: judd-gregg (republican party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: On one hand, the TARP legislation is quite clear: Section 106, Part D of the TARP legislation: ""Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt. ""But we also talked with budget experts who said that Congress could get around those rules in a number of ways. For example, Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use it to pay other expenses, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants,"" Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, told us in December. In Gregg's case, though, he's strictly talking about what the law says, thatTARP money cannot be used for anything other than deficit reduction."

Analysis: In his effort to catalog Milwaukees woes, former Acting Mayor Marvin Pratt said the citys unemployment rate among black males tops 50 percent. Pratt said he was relating the finding of a recent UWM study. But that study uses a broader ""joblessness"" measure than the conventional unemployment rate, and looks at the full metropolitan area, not just the city. As such, Pratt falls into a trap others have before him -- stating one measure as another."
"Statement: Rob Cornilles has disputed for two years a news story that said he said he would cut Social Security and Medicare programs before trimming the U.S. defense budget.
Speaker: rob-cornilles (republican party)
Topic: medicare,social-security

Analysis: But she provided videos from a September 2010 debate with David Wu, in which he denies saying he would cut entitlements, and a recent interview with KATU(2) in which Cornilles said he would cut defense spending before entitlements. However, it wasnt until last weeks debate that Cornilles directly called the article into question. Cornilles has said in at least one previous debate and in a recent interview that he wouldnt cut entitlements, but that doesnt amount to disputing the story for two years."

"Statement: Harry Reid has voted to give special tax breaks to illegal aliens.
Speaker: sharron-angle (republican party)
Topic: immigration,message-machine,taxes

Analysis: We'll agree that it'sfair for Angle to paint Reid as something less than Draconian in his stance toward former illegal immigrants. However, we find little to support the charge that Reid voted to ""give special tax breaks to illegal aliens. ""Most of the Angle camp's cited votes were actually aimed at people in the U. S.  legally (even though they may formerly have been illegal), and in at least two cases, wedisagree thatwhat was being voted on represented a ""special tax break"" at all."
"Statement: Job growth in the United States is now at the fastest pace in this countrys history.
Speaker: david-simas (democrat party)

Analysis: Simas said job growth in the United States is now at the ""fastest pace in this country's history. ""He would have been right if hed stuck to the duration of the recovery: At 60 months and counting, its the longest post-war recovery, though earlier recoveries would have been longer had brief blips not intruded."
"Statement: When asked about equal pay for women, (Rubios) quote was that it was a waste of time.
Speaker: patrick-murphy (democrat party)
Topic: labor,women

Analysis: Murphy said, ""When asked about equal pay for women, (Rubios) quote was that it was a waste of time. ""Rubio did use the expression to describe Democratic efforts to advance the Paycheck Fairness Act. Rubio thought the bill focused too much on allowing workers to sue employers for discrimination, and not enough time focusing on job training and other solutions. Thats not the same as dismissing efforts to close the gender pay gap out of hand. Murphy misrepresented the context of Rubios response."
"Statement: Atlanta has issued an increasing number of citations - and collected an increasing amount of revenue - since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010.
Speaker: reader-email (none party)
Topic: crime,public-safety

Analysis: The reason was money, the reader argued. We couldnt confirm the numbers the reader had calculated. But our research showed that tickets issued since Reed took office have increased, both when issued by city police and the citys outsourced parking enforcer. Combined, the number of citations increased about 16 percent in that time  and the revenue collected from them swelled a whopping 45 percent. City leaders have a point that some growth would be expected, given the private parking enforcement and the increase in officers in the city. Proving the motivation  increased revenue, more focused policing or a combination of both  is difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint."
"Statement: Says he was known as Veto Corleone for cutting spending as Florida governor.
Speaker: jeb-bush (republican party)
Topic: state-budget

Analysis: Bush said ""they called me Veto Corleone"" as governor for his frequent use of the line-item veto. He did have a fondness for ruthlessly slashing projects he deemed wasteful or not in line with his agenda. Thrasher confirmed he nicknamed the governor after the fictional mobster. This is one favor we grant Bush."
"Statement: The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980.
Speaker: sean-spicer (republican party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Spicer said the last time Republican Senate candidates ""beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980. ""Republicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats."
"Statement: On how to respond to Puerto Ricos debt crisis.
Speaker: sean-duffy (republican party)
Topic: debt,deficit

Analysis: His position has been that, just like the 50 states, Puerto Rico itself should not be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Rather, municipalities and governmental units in the territory should be placed on par with those in the 50 states, and they should be allowed to declare bankruptcy. Our rating From the beginning, Duffy warned against allowing Puerto Rico as a territory to declare bankruptcy. Despite the suggestion of the radio ad, the bill he is sponsoring does not allow bankruptcy for general obligation bonds."
"Statement: The State of Rhode Island has the worst state-funded pension in the country.
Speaker: helen-glover (talk-show-host party)
Topic: deficit,pensions,state-budget,state-finances

Analysis: Her statement was based on sources that either misread the numbers or mixed old data with new. Using the latest 2010 numbers from Pew, Rhode Island ranks no lower than second from the bottom, and the state's standing may improve as other states report their figures. And when we sought out other sources, such as Moody's and Boston College, we couldn't find any ranking that put Rhode Island at the bottom of the barrel when it came to pension funding. That doesn't detract from Rhode Island's profoundly perilous pension problem. But being in last place is a very specific distinction, and we're not there -- yet.

Analysis: Camp said, ""In 2009 . . . Hillary Clinton was at the State Dept working with U. S.  corporations to pressure Haiti not to raise the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour from 24 cents. ""Leaked cables show that the U. S.  Embassy in Haiti opposed the minimum wage hike that the Haitian parliament passed in 2009, and discussed the issue with business groups. Update, April 21, 2016:After we published this fact-check, the State Department told us it had no public, official position in the Haitian minimum wage debate. ""The U. S.  Department of State did not officially oppose or support the three-step proposed minimum wage increases in Haiti  in 2009, 2010, and 2012  as this was an internal matter,"" a spokesperson said.

Analysis:  And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD. com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: ""It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active  let's put it that way. ""We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he ""was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry."
"Statement: I've cast a couple of 99-1 votes and been the lone dissenter.

Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: ""I don't think the federal government ought to be federalizing something that's been under the state purview for 200 years,"" Thompson told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, Sept.  7, 2007. ""Give me a good reason why, when the federal government. . . can't get its own act together, why it ought to be taking on these other things in order to get a press release and a headline?. . .

Topic: county-budget,criminal-justice

Analysis: Whats more, if we looked at every department that way, tens of millions of dollars in county tax dollars would magically disappear from the books -- but not from that tax bill in your mailbox. Our conclusion    Clarke says he ""never asked for more"" than inflationary budget increases in his 10 budgets as Milwaukee County sheriff. But the bottom line is, Clarkes redefinition of his budget requests is unofficial and not recorded in county records."
"Statement: Under New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, homicides are up by 20 percent, and subway delays have soared 45 percent.
Speaker: greg-gutfeld (republican party)
Topic: crime,transportation

Analysis: Gutfeld faulted the performance of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and noted that murders are up 20 percent and subway delays are up 45 percent. Gutfelds numbers are correct, but he commits extreme cherry picking with the murder statistic. A full year assessment of de Blasios administration would show that the murder rate is holding about steady compared to the year before he took office. As for the increased suffering of subway riders, it is real, but a large portion of that falls outside of de Blasios direct control. The state wields final authority over the trains. While de Blasio could press to add more city funds, he doesnt control the budget and his representatives represent less than a quarter of the votes on the MTA board."
"Statement: And delivered more tax relief than the other Republicans combined.
Speaker: rudy-giuliani (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: How do you factor in fees?Nevertheless, the Club for Growth prepared reports on each candidate's record on economic issues. Her conclusion: ""It is clear that Giuliani did successfully push through more tax relief than Romney or Huckabee. ""Given the many confirming sources, it's clear Giuliani has a strong record on tax cutting."
"Statement: Says U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith supported the $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008, ""but now he is standing in the way of reforms that would assure these bailouts would never happen again.
Speaker: lainey-melnick (democrat party)
Topic: campaign-finance,economy,financial-regulation

Analysis: Though she accurately recaps two of  Smiths votes on bills dealing with the financial sector, the  Democratic-supported reform legislation wont -- as Melnick acknowledges  -- end bailouts. Also, Smiths campaign coffers have benefited from  contributions from the financial sector, yet thats a charge that could  be leveled against many members including Texans who have fielded more  in such donations."
"Statement: #GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing.

Analysis: Rowden tweeted: ""#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing. ""Without the Affordable Care Act, MU wouldnt have had to remove subsidies for graduate students. But MU can still provide health insurance for its student employees  all without breaking the law. The university could, for example, create a student group health plan for graduate its graduate student employees. The first part of Rowdens tweet is accurate but takes things out context. The second part of the statement isnt accurate."
"Statement: Says President Obama has waived the work requirement for welfare.
Speaker: rick-santorum (republican party)
Topic: welfare

Analysis: Santorum said that Obama ""showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare. ""By granting waivers to states, HHS is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. The waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. And there have been no comments by the Obama administration indicating such a dramatic shift in policy."
"Statement: 7 out of 10 Oregon families living in poverty have at least one parent who works.
Speaker: oregon-center-public-policy (organization party)
Topic: children,families,income,poverty,welfare

Analysis: We checked Gettels analysis and confirmed his results. We also confirmed the analysis and numbers with the U. S.  Census Bureau. While the numbers are accurate, under the survey design, somebody classified by federal employment officials as ""long-term unemployed"" could be counted as working under the Census definition. We think thats an important clarification."
"Statement: Ninety-seven percent of the time. Thats how often Mark Warner votes with President Obama.
Speaker: republican-party-virginia (republican party)
Topic: message-machine-2014,voting-record

Analysis: The Republican Party of Virginia says Warner has voted with Obama ""97 percent of the time. ""Warner, since entering the Senate in 2009, indeed has taken the same position as the president 97 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, according to Congressional Quarterly. That includes voting for Obamacare. The presidential support rating is by no means a wide measure of performance by Warner or any other member of Congress. The president staked out a position on only 28 percent of the Senate roll call votes since 2009 and more than half of those were to confirm presidential appointments. Senate Democrats, on the whole, have backed the president 95. 4 percent of the time during Warners term. It should be noted that broad voting studies by the National Journal and Open Congress rate Warner as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate. Warners presidential support rating, however, is what it is: 97 percent."
"Statement: Says Rick Perry is a 25-year incumbent.
Speaker: bill-white (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,job-accomplishments

Analysis: Our call: White's poke accurately tabulates Perry's seven-plus terms in four different offices. But describing Perry as a ""25-year incumbent"" in a critique focused on his governorship blurs the fact that most of the time Perry's held office, he's not been governor  or in a single elected position."
"Statement: Says an array of statistics show that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rival that of the West Bank in Palestine, North Korea, and distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: poverty,public-health

Analysis: Sanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rivaled that of ""the West Bank in Palestine,"" ""North Korea,"" and ""distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. Some of Sanders figures need to be updated, but the gist of his specific comparisons are accurate: 12 Baltimore neighborhoods have a lower life expectancy than North Korea; 11 have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank; and research shows health conditions are worse for poor teens than in Baltimore than in Ibadan, New Delhi and Shanghai."
"Statement: The House passed a pay-as-you-go rule that said, ""If you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc., you had to pay for it.""
Speaker: nancy-pelosi (democrat party)
Topic: federal-budget,stimulus

Analysis: But the second part of her statement -- ""if you wanted to have an investment, an entitlement, etc. Investments made with discretionary spending, from highway-building to elementary school aid, were never supposed to be subject to PAYGO. Nor were ordinary increases in entitlements. In addition, even for key bills that should have been subject to PAYGO, Democratic leaders have acted to waive the rule on several occasions."
"Statement: The numbers make it clear that Georgia voters are increasingly taking advantage of early voting opportunities.
Speaker: brian-kemp (republican party)
Topic: education

Analysis: In 2011, early voting was reduced to 21 days, ending the Friday before the election and including at least one Saturday of early voting. In the 2012 presidential election, 1. 9 million early votes were cast. Thats up from about 420,000 in 2004, the first time Georgians could vote early in a presidential election."
"Statement: Says Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Speaker: diane-allen (republican party)

"Statement: On running for the presidency in 2012
Speaker: chris-christie (republican party)

"Statement: Rhode Island is almost dead last among Northeastern states in the length of time first-degree murderers must spend in prison before theyre eligible for parole.
Speaker: leonidas-raptakis (democrat party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice,legal-issues,states

Analysis: State Sen.  Leonidas Raptakis said Rhode Island is ""almost dead last"" among Northeastern states in the amount of time first-degree murderers must serve before they are eligible for parole. When we examined the statutes in each of the states he cited, we found that all except Virginia have stricter sentencing requirements than Rhode Island."
"Statement: All the really great programs in American history, Social Security, was done without Republicans. Medicare was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board.
Speaker: howard-dean (democrat party)
Topic: health-care,history,medicare

Analysis: (President Barack Obama would probably love to get even that much GOP backing. )So we find Dean is glossing over the details and exaggerating the partisan split. Both Social Security and Medicare were indeed championed by Democrats, but passed with the help of Republican votes. And while some GOP members waited until the last minute to support Medicare, it was backed by half the Republicans on the Senate committee."
"Statement: Diane Black voted to fund Obamacare.
Speaker: lou-ann-zelenik (republican party)
Topic: congress,congressional-rules,health-care

Analysis: Our ruling  The public record shows Rep.  Black has voted more than two dozen times to repeal President Obamas health-care reforms and defund them. But was Black really very specifically ""voting to fund Obamacare"" or was she voting to keep the government from shutting down"
"Statement: Hurricane Sandy, the most destructive Atlantic storm ever.
Speaker: environment-new-jersey (none party)
Topic: climate-change,environment,weather

Analysis: Sandy may be the most destructive storm to hit a part of the Eastern Seaboard but in terms of most destructive Atlantic storms, that title goes to Katrina, which formed in the Atlantic and whose damages topped $100 billion, according to Hurricane Center data. Sandy, however, is very high on the list, with damages totaling at least $82 billion. Still, thats not number one in todays dollars or compared with storms adjusted for inflation in 2010."
"Statement: The Hispanic population in Gwinnett and Henry counties has increased by 153 percent and 339 percent, respectively, since 2000 while Republican presidential candidates are getting a smaller percentage of the vote in those counties.
Speaker: karl-rove (republican party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Roves numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought. African-American voters, who got cursory mention in his remarks, may have had a larger influence on the performance of GOP presidential candidates in those counties. That context is necessary to fully consider why GOP candidates did not do as well in Gwinnett and Henry counties."
"Statement: I was the most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate.
Speaker: scott-brown (republican party)
Topic: bipartisanship,voting-record

Analysis: Judging by votes alone, Brown was not always the most bipartisan senator during his time in office, but he was No. 1 for a time, and was close for the rest of the time."
"Statement: Says Gov. Scott Walker raises the pay of inmates, but we dont raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions.
Speaker: marty-beil (none party)
Topic: criminal-justice,income,state-finances,unions,workers

Analysis: So, the higher pay rate is limited to the relatively few working inmates at one prison, and only applies to their first two months on the job. Our rating    Beil said Walker has raised the pay of working inmates, ""but we don't raise the pay of staff in our correctional institutions. ""Neither group, however, has received a pay raise. The pay rate at one prison is now higher for new workers during their two-month probation period, but that was done not to give inmates raises but to save money for taxpayers."
"Statement: The current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chiefs ability to be commander-in-chief.
Speaker: adam-kinzinger (republican party)
Topic: congress,history,military,terrorism

Analysis: Kinzinger said that the authorization for use of military force now pending in Congress would represent ""the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief. ""A plain reading of that statement finds it problematic. Time and time again, Congress has intervened to rein in presidents from taking certain types of actions or continuing combat longer than lawmakers want. To do this, Congress simply has to use the power it is granted in the Constitution, authority that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by courts for centuries. Even the narrower interpretation of the statement that Kinzingers office stands by  that it only refers to the war on terrorism  doesnt hold up."
"Statement: U.S. debt is now equal to 100 percent of the GDP.
Speaker: rob-portman (republican party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget

Analysis: Problem is, local and state debt are not part of the broad, divisive debate that led to creation of the new super committee. Portmans committee is dealing with federal deficits and debt, not the debt of Parma. And when Portman said ""the U. S.  debt now equals 100 percent of the GDP,"" it was clear -- as it has been from weeks of debate in Washington -- which debt he meant. The gross debt hasnt reached 100 percent, but it will."
"Statement: Tom Ganley supports a 23 percent national sales tax that would raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself.
Speaker: ohio-democratic-party (democrat party)

Analysis: And classifying it as a tax that would ""raise taxes on the middle class while giving a huge tax break to millionaires like himself"" adds in a dose of political hyperbole."
"Statement: Pat Toomey still supports privatizing Social Security.
Speaker: joe-sestak (democrat party)
Topic: message-machine,market-regulation,social-security

Analysis: We see his argument, but we still think the ad overplays its hand. The ad is correct that Toomey supports a type of privatization -- in fact, he's been quite open about it -- but that privatization proposal is limited and optional. The Toomey plan also wouldn't directly affect today's seniors, and it may or may not affect any of today's seniors who are still alive years down the road. This clashes with the ad's visuals, which seem directly targeted at older voters, not younger ones."
"Statement: The marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that Jeb Bush smoked 40 years ago.

Analysis: Fiorina said the marijuana kids smoke today is not what it was 40 years ago. THC potency is up, with a growing fraction of seized marijuana having a concentration of 9 percent or more."
"Statement: Barack Obama voted against born alive legislation in Illinois that was virtually identical to the federal law.
Speaker: national-right-life-committee (none party)
Topic: abortion

Analysis: But the federal neutrality clause wasn't sufficient to reassure the Illinois legislators seeking to protect abortion rights. The law that passed had additional explicit protection for existing state law and generally accepted medical standards. The bill's sponsor said in 2008 that the extra language was included to satisfy ""the most zealous prochoice legislators. ""But the National Right to Life Committee is correct that the 2003 version of the law did include a neutrality clause similar to the federal legislation, and Obama voted against it."

Analysis: The Funny or Die video said Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China. We found examples of all of these products made in the countries Jeong and Goolsbee mentioned, with the exception of a suit made in Mexico. But we did find suits made in other countries, and there are examples of other Trump clothing products made in Mexico. Some suits, in fact, are made in the United States."
"Statement: Says President Barack Obama has opened up no new trade relationships with other nations.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: economy,foreign-policy,new-hampshire-2012,trade

Analysis: It did take the better part of three years for Obama and Congress to enact the languishing South Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements. But ultimately he did reach an accord with lawmakers that enabled the agreements relatively easy passage in both the House and the Senate, including strong support from Republicans as well as the votes of several dozen Democratic lawmakers."
"Statement: Says taxpayer subsidy for the Oregon Convention Center hotel jumped $100 million in closed-door sessions

But thats a separate issue. So we also find OUCH accurate on that point."
"Statement: Says you can buy four light bulbs for $1.99 at Walmart, while a single compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) costs $10 a pop.
Speaker: joe-barton (republican party)
Topic: energy,market-regulation

Analysis: However, Walmart also sells some CFLs for less and other incandescent bulbs for more. More importantly, Barton ignores other relevant factors  wattage and longevity  that undercut a simple price comparison and his suggestion that a ""mainstream,"" two-income family can't afford such energy-saving bulbs."
"Statement: (Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose.
Speaker: american-bridge-21st-century (democrat party)

Analysis: American Bridge said ""Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose. ""Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesnt note one important point: State law allows him to do that. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information."
"Statement: History tells us that job growth always lags behind economic growth.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: The     San Francisco Chronicle    , relying on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August charted the lag between recessions' end and the peak of unemployment rates. In the eight recessions between 1949 and 1991, unemployment rates lagged by an average of about three months. After the last two, however, it took 15 months and 19 months, respectively, before unemployment rates peaked. Bottom line, President Obama is right when he cautions that employment has lagged behind economic recovery in the past."
"Statement: Bill Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade.
Speaker: susan-stimpson (republican party)
Topic: taxes,voting-record

Analysis: Stimpson says ""Howell has been the consistent force behind every major tax increase in Virginia in the last decade. ""Shes right on the transportation tax bills that were passed in 2007 and 2013. Howell sponsored the measures and encouraged fellow House Republicans to vote for them. Theres complexity to the speakers role in the passage of the 2004 tax increase for education, public safety and health programs. Howell consistently spoke out against the bill and voted against it. But the bill survived a hostile House committee because Howell persuaded four conservative allies to skip the vote. This was a political miscalculation by the speaker rather than a nod of support. Howell was under pressure to let the full House vote on the measure. He was outmaneuvered a week later when 17 Republicans joined Democrats to narrowly pass the tax hike. Howell retaliated by stripping leaders of the GOP revolt of some duties. So we find Stimpsons statement accurate, but in need of this clarification: Howell was an unwitting force behind one of the tax increases."

Analysis: Congressional candidate Michael Riley says that with the help of U. S.  Rep.  Jim Langevin, President Obama ""cut $716 billion from Medicare.

Analysis: But this threat has grown, primarily  and this is the irony  the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran. This isnt the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. He has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign. Obama never said the threat from Iran was tiny or insignificant, only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. And if the McCain campaign was unclear on that point, it should have been clear after Obama's comment in May that ""Iran is a grave threat."
"Statement: Barbara Boxers worried about the weather instead of terrorism as the biggest threat to national security.
Speaker: carly-fiorina (republican party)
Topic: candidates-biography,environment,homeland-security,message-machine,terrorism

Analysis: So to recap, Fiorina is guilty of a major distortion here. Boxer brought up climate change and said it was ""one of the very important national security issues,"" but Fiorina ignores that wording and portrays it as if Boxer cited it as the only priority. In addition, Fiorina casts climate change as something you need to pack an umbrella for, or that prompts you to curse at the TV weatherman -- which strikes us as not only a trivialization of climate change but also a failure to distinguish between two well-established scientific specialties. She also ignores Boxer's lengthy record supporting bills against terrorism."
"Statement: We spend three times more on entitlements and debt services than we do on defense.
Speaker: sarah-palin (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,social-security

Analysis: Defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total, but not the entire amount. Meanwhile, if you total up the budget for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- the three big entitlements most familiar to Americans -- it accounts for about two-thirds of the budget formandatory programs. The ""other mandatory programs"" category includes such things as veterans' benefits. Despite these distinctions, we think it's reasonable for Palin to describe all security programs as ""defense"" and all mandatory programs as ""entitlements. ""In all, then, we rate this comment by Palin much more favorably than we do her other comment from the same speech."
"Statement: In the 2014 elections, the American people overwhelmingly said we dont want Obamacare and we dont want amnesty.
Speaker: ted-cruz (republican party)
Topic: health-care,immigration,polls

Analysis: Cruz said that in the 2014 elections, ""the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare  and we don't want amnesty. ""Exit poll data shows that, at most, Americans were slightly -- not ""overwhelmingly"" -- against Obamacare, and even that edge is in doubt because the lead for the anti-Obamacare side is within the margin of error. Meanwhile, exit poll data also shows that voters, by a 3-to-2 margin, actually favored offering the possibility of legal status to illegal immigrants."
"Statement: Dan Patrick got caught not paying his taxes and pocketed his employees payroll taxes.
Speaker: david-dewhurst (republican party)
Topic: bankruptcy,candidates-biography,taxes

Analysis: Dewhurst said Patrick got caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees payroll taxes. Patrick also had liens filed against him for unpaid state and local sales taxes. Documents indicate Patrick caught up on his federal tax tab in 1989 and met his sales tax obligations in 2006, the year he ran for the Senate. We see no confirmation, though, that Patrick ""pocketed"" employees payroll taxes, though such taxes did go unpaid to the government at times."
"Statement: Says Merrick Garland authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists.
Speaker: pat-toomey (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,military,supreme-court,terrorism

Analysis: Toomey wrote that Garland ""authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists. ""We have no definitive proof that the Uighur detainees engaged in terrorist acts or were ""violent Islamist extremists. ""They were an oppressed ethnic minority in China and may have been caught up in events without endorsing terrorism. The courts released them because the governments case against them seemed dubious."
"Statement: Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014.
Speaker: facebook-posts (none party)
Topic: congress

Analysis: The meme said that Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96. 4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected. We found small differences in the actual percentages -- Congress had roughly a 14 percent approval rate, and the incumbent re-election rate may be as low as 95 percent -- but the point of the meme is solid. Voters hold Congress in low regard, yet they re-elect almost everyone."
"Statement: Letting the Bush tax cuts expire would raise taxes on small businesses.
Speaker: eric-cantor (republican party)
Topic: economy,small-business,taxes

Analysis: That hardly sounds like a corner shop owner, whose image Cantor seems to invoke when he says Democrats are trying to raise taxes on small businesses. (Cantors wife, Diana F.  Cantor, is a member of the board of directors of Media General Inc. , parent company of the Richmond Times-Dispatch)."
"Statement: Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws ... fatalities go up and abortions actually increase.
Speaker: nickie-antonio (democrat party)
Topic: abortion,government-regulation,women

Analysis: One of the studys authors, in fact, specifically said the study did not establish that cause-and-effect relationship and that other factors were in play. Nor did the study look at abortion rates and fatalities for individual states -- something Antonio mentioned in her statement. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression."
"Statement: The presidents budget would take ... non-defense spending to its lowest level ... as a percentage of the economy since JFK.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,military

Analysis: Ultimately, we do think that Obama was careful not to over-sell his point. He said that his budget ""would reduce . . . non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years. ""That's more cautious than saying it ""will reduce"" such spending to a record-low level. But we think it's essential to keep in mind that these are the president's intentions -- not firm data."
"Statement: Of the approximately 6 million disenfranchised felons in the United States, one-quarter are Floridians.
Speaker: desmond-meade (none party)
Topic: crime,elections

Analysis: Meade said that of the approximately 6 million disenfranchised felons in the United States, ""one-quarter are Floridians. ""The numbers come from research done two professors, Uggen and Manza, who concluded that 5. 85 million felons couldnt vote nationally as of December 2010, including 1. 5 million in Florida -- about a quarter. However, part of the researchers totals are based on an estimate of ex-cons who have completed their sentences but still cant vote. We couldnt find any alternative calculations, but different methods of estimation could reveal different figures."
"Statement: Obama ""basically threatened to bomb Pakistan.""
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: foreign-policy

Analysis: So the United States is already doing what Obama is advocating. We might give Clinton points for qualifying her remarks with ""basically. ""But even with that qualifier, she is twisting Obama's comments to imply he wants to attack a U. S.  ally."
"Statement: The Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his [transportation] plan.
Speaker: ward-armstrong (democrat party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: Armstrong wrote the ""Governor did not consult members of his own party before he released his plan. ""Clearly, not every Republican legislator was in the loop. While not every GOP legislator was in the loop, plenty were involved in shaping the plan and the Republican leadership says they were kept informed along the way."
"Statement: Ohio has lost more population than every other state in the country except for two.
Speaker: john-kasich (republican party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: Another concern is that while Ohio hasnt lost population, other states are gaining new residents faster. The most immediate consequence of that for the state is a loss of clout in Washington, where Ohio will lose two of its 18 congressional seats and have fewer electoral college votes for presidential elections due to the population trends. We offered the governor-elect the benefit the doubt, but from any angle you look at it, Ohio did not lose population from this year over last, or in 2009 from 2008, or this year compared to 2000. On this one, Kasich doesnt need sensational talk to highlight a problematic issue."
"Statement: Here in California, Donald Trump has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris.
Speaker: ted-cruz (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance,elections

Analysis: But Cruz leaves out the fact that the donations to the California governor took place a decade ago, before the Democrat ran for re-election to the states top office. Trumps contributions to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013."
"Statement: Gov. Rick Perry has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years.
Speaker: back-basics (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis: We found White no more responsible for the privately funded clinic than he was for the weather or baseball playoffs during his tenure. In this case, Back to Basics' numbers stand up: The state's unemployment rate under Perry has hit a 22-year high. But the suggestion that the governor is to blame does not."
"Statement: On support for the auto bailouts.
Speaker: terri-lynn-land (republican party)
Topic: congress,transportation

Analysis: On the campaign trail so far, she has mostly avoided a direct answer to the question. Her campaign recently said she supported it. In 2012, she said she supported Romneys plan, which would have required private financing  not government money  to get the auto companies out of bankruptcy, and held up Ford, which rejected any government money, as a model. Her comments, read in full, are critical of how things played out. Earlier this year, she said she would have pushed for something ""more along the lines what Ford did,"" which is even further from the auto bailout than what Romney supported. But on Sept.  25, her campaign said she ""would have supported the auto rescue."
"Statement: Ed Gillespies 2006 book promoted an individual health care mandate, and recommends that it be enforced by the IRS through the income tax code.
Speaker: democratic-party-virginia (democrat party)
Topic: medicaid,taxes

Analysis: Democrats said Gillespies book ""promoted an individual mandate. ""Gillespies 2006 memoir states that one way of reforming health care is to require people to carry insurance or have their standard tax deduction cut in half. That fits the definition of an individual mandate. Gillespies campaign denies this is the case, but declines to provide a clear explanation. It should be noted that Gillespie offered tax consequences as one possibility for reforming health care. His book suggested Health Savings Account as another way to ensure adults get coverage. Websters New World College Dictionary defines ""promote"" as ""to help bring about"" something. Although it may not have been Gillespies intention, his unclear book passage can be easily interpreted as advancing the idea of individual mandates during a formative time for health policy."
"Statement: When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights Blake Rocap stopped them.
Speaker: blake-rocap (democrat party)
Topic: abortion,candidates-biography

Analysis: Rocap said in a voter mailer: ""When Republican extremists tried to take away abortion rights Blake Rocap stopped them. ""Rocap ranks among Texas ""pro-choice"" advocates who battled and sometimes derailed Republican moves pitched as reducing the prevalence of abortion. ButRepublicans also ultimately passed multiple restrictions into law; no one stopped that."
"Statement: Says Obama refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,israel,message-machine-2012

Analysis: The ad says Obama ""refuses to recognize Jerusalem"" as the capital of Israel. As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israels capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process. Thats not so much a refusal on his part but a continuation of the line taken before him by previous presidents. Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA under his administration note Jerusalem as Israels capital, with a footnote attached. Romneys ad portrays Obamas position as a betrayal of an ally."
"Statement: Says he helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill.
Speaker: tim-canova (democrat party)
Topic: congress,financial-regulation

Analysis: Canova says he ""helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill. ""The Dodd-Frank bill was a sweeping piece of legislation with many components. Canova was involved in one piece of the bill. Canova played a behind-the-scenes role advising a House staff member and a Senate staff member about amendments to allow the government to audit the Federal Reserve. A scaled-back version was included in the final law. Canova didnt contribute to the drafting ofthe overall bill, and he wasn'tthe main driver of the audit portion thatstemmed from decades of advocacy by Paul. However, he did play a role."
"Statement: Says income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Sanders said income tax rates under Eisenhower were as high as 90 percent. A look through the records shows that top earners in the eight years of Eisenhowers presidency paid a top income tax rate of 91 percent. It was even a bit higher before he took office."
"Statement: American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62.9% - lowest rate in 51yrs.
Speaker: donald-trump (republican party)
Topic: economy,housing

Analysis: Trump said homeownership is at its lowest since 1965. The numbers back him up. However, there are some caveats. Some of the decline is due to lifestyle, and not economic, changes. In addition, experts told us the housing market is not in as dire straits as one statistic suggests."
"Statement: Romneys Medicare plan was estimated to cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: debates,medicare,retirement

Analysis: Obama is repeating a number about an old Republican plan because there isnt an updated analysis of the new plan, which contains significant differences."
"Statement: If we had the same staffing ratio (of officers to residents) as Seattle, wed have 300 more officers in our department.
Speaker: michael-reese (none party)
Topic: public-safety

Analysis: If you take the population of each city, were short about 300 officers if we want to match Seattles resident-to-officer ratio. Even if you control for the number of people in the surrounding metro area, we seem to be lagging pretty considerably. *CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the population of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro-area population."
"Statement: Department of Veterans Affairs doctors are prohibited from recommending medical marijuana.
Speaker: campaign-regulate-marijuana-alcohol (none party)

"Statement: When career politician Daniel Webster became speaker of the House, he wasted $32,000 of our money on a spiral staircase for his office.
Speaker: alan-grayson (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,ethics,message-machine,state-budget,taxes

Analysis: After publication, Webster spokesman Brian Graham said in an e-mail that the staircase actually cost less than published reports. The original construction contract was for $28,126. The state paid even less, $22,242, Graham said). (Update Sept.  3: We noticed that the Grayson ad has been removed from his You Tube web page."
"Statement: Texas had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the primary.
Speaker: greg-abbott (republican party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: Abbott said Texas ""had the highest level of turnout than ever before in the"" 2016 ""primary. ""We dont know if Abbott was tunnel-visioning raw counts of primary voters or if he was fixed on the 19 percent share of registered voters participating in the Republican primary. By both of these metrics, the 2016 turnout set Texas records. However, percentage turnout across both primaries was previously higher in several years including 2008, 1988 and 1972. This gubernatorial statement also failed to acknowledge that Texas remains among the nations lowest-turnout states."
"Statement: Says the difference between her and Barack Obama is ""about 35 years of experience.""
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography

Analysis: Although we find     here    that she is largely correct when she says she has 35 years of experience in politics, she has failed to include Obama's experience in her calculation. By our count, Obama, who is 14 years younger than Clinton, has about one year running a voter-registration project, three years as a community organizer, four as a full-time attorney handling voting rights, employment and housing cases, and 12 years in the Illinois Senate and U. S.  Senate. That's a total of 20 years in public policy matters. So the difference between Clinton and Obama is really 15 years."
"Statement: 22 veterans take their own lives each day.
Speaker: kamala-harris (democrat party)
Topic: veterans

Analysis: Kamala Harris recently said ""22 veterans take their own lives each day. ""The number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats. That old reporthas been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris opponent in her run for U. S.  Senate. Harris statement isclose, but needs clarification or additional information."
"Statement: The United States is the only major country on earth that doesnt guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege.
Speaker: bernie-s (independent party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: Sanders said that the United States is the only major country that doesnt guarantee health care to everyone as a right. Among the wealthy OECD nations, America -- with the possible exception of Mexico -- stands out as the only one that lacks universal coverage. The question of a guaranteed right to health care is murkier. Sanders spoke as though every advanced economy has it. In reality, some do and some dont."
"Statement: Said former U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails.
Speaker: david-shuster (none party)
Topic: ethics,transparency

Analysis: Shuster said Gration was forced to resign because of his use of personal email accounts. That was one issue State Department officials raised. But just one of many. The State Department Inspector Generals report paints a much more troubling picture of an embassy in disarray under Grations leadership. In the words of the auditors, Gration ""has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission. ""Gration ranked at or near the absolute bottom among other ambassadors assessed by the department. His use of email was an issue, but according to an ambassador with much experience, it was a relatively minor one."
"Statement: Says Florida is a model for successful pretrial release programs.
Speaker: john-oliver (none party)
Topic: crime,criminal-justice

Analysis: Oliver said ""pretrial service programs have succeeded around the country,"" namely Florida, adding, ""And it is a truly frightening state of affairs when Florida is a model for progressive change. ""Experts in pretrial justice, several of whom talked with Olivers staff, said certain counties within Florida have demonstrated success with pretrial services as a way to reduce jail costs and eliminate overcrowding in jails. But they said he went a bit too far in leaving his viewers with the idea that Florida is among states that go above and beyond for defendants. There are pockets of progress, advocates said, but the commercial bail bonding industry is also strong in the state, and not every county has pretrial services."
"Statement: If you have ever visited Nashville or Washington D.C. you will see MANY names and initials carved into ... desks.
Speaker: julia-hurley (republican party)
Topic: government-efficiency

Analysis: In Nashville, such carving is effectively prohibited  though it seems there have apparently been occasional episodes of unauthorized carving by someone. Those could have been done by legislators or by most anyone, since the Capitol is open to visits by the public most of the time. There could be other hidden and unauthorized carvings inside some locked desk drawers. But there are surely not ""many"" carvings of any sort outside the U. S.  Senate, and what the representative suggests is a tradition is impossible in U. S.  House and prohibited in the state House and state Senate."
"Statement: Redistribution has never been a characteristic of America.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: economy,federal-budget,history,taxes

Analysis: Romney said that ""redistribution"" has ""never been a characteristic of America. ""Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of it, but redistribution has been a basic principle of the U. S.  tax system and many federal programs, including some such as veterans benefits that have long attracted support from Republicans."
"Statement: Tampa is the strip club capital of the world.
Speaker: ellyn-bogdanoff (republican party)
Topic: economy,pop-culture

Analysis: But we're not quite there, in large part because we were unable to find precise strip club data for Tampa. Experts say Tampa isn't even the strip club capital of Florida."
"Statement: Said they reached a power-sharing agreement with Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle
Speaker: republican-state-senators (republican party)

Analysis: In the aftermath of the Macon coup, the GOP Senate leadership now has all the power. And it doesn't plan to share it with Cagle."
"Statement: Says between 6 and 20 bicycles can be parked in the space required by one car.
Speaker: earl-blumenauer (democrat party)
Topic: transportation

Analysis: As for the mechanical lifts available at PSU: Those wont be showing on city streets anytime soon. City policies allow only one-tier corrals, and businesses that already pay the city $2,600 to install one seem unlikely to want to pony up more. Blumenauers office does cite a study with a footnote leading to another study that says 10 to 20 bikes can fit into a single parking spot. The congressmans website also gives a range of 6 to 20 bikes, while 12 can commonly fit in corrals."
"Statement: I unsealed my records at Marquette University.
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)

"Statement: Says that U.S. Rep. Allen West is a constituent of mine.
Speaker: debbie-wasserman-schultz (democrat party)

Analysis: But on the matter at hand, Wasserman Schultz is correct that she can count West as a constituent. And it's okay, according to the U. S.  Constitution."
"Statement: The U.S. gives foreign aid to Cuba and Venezuela, even though those countries are our enemies.
Speaker: ted-poe (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget,foreign-policy

Analysis: However, Chavez has made his opposition to U. S.  aid clear, and has even gone so far as to prosecute some opponents who have taken it. Meanwhile, the aid sent to Cuba is certainly not going into the governments coffers, and it, like the Venezuela aid, is considered far likelier to undercut the government than support it. The relatively small amounts of money sent to those two countries is primarily going to bolstering an opposition to their governments."
"Statement: Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: climate-change,environment

Analysis: Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. The Texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor."
"Statement: if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!
Speaker: senior-citizens-league (none party)
Topic: social-security

Analysis: Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution: Its hard to see how the description of totalization agreements ""can be squared with the idea that foreign citizens who receive Social Security would be exempt from a legislated cut in Social Security benefits that applies to U. S. The pending agreement has not been approved by the United States or Mexico, but to exclude some citizens from any cuts would require an exemption by Congress that is highly unlikely."
"Statement: Earlier this year, [John DePetro] was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker.
Speaker: our-daughters-ri (organization party)
Topic: crime,legal-issues,pundits,unions,women

Analysis: For Our Daughters RI, in its petition calling for the removal of talk-radio host John DePetro, said, ""Earlier this year, he was accused of sexually assaulting a female co-worker. ""DePetro was accused of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed in 2012, not 2013. The suit, which has laid dormant according to court records, never alleges sexual assault. Both sexual harassment and sexual assault are serious allegations. But the former is a civil matter and the latter can send you to prison, and relegate an ex-convict to a life of a registered sex offender. We would expect a group devoted to protecting women to know the difference. Yet For Our Daughters RI is standing by its allegation, selectively quoting from a federal definition of sexual assault and neglecting the fact that the definition does not include sexual harassment.

""The approval ratings for the United States did go up on Hillary Clintons watch, and the Pew poll found that in some countries they did go up by 19 points or more.

Analysis: MoveOn. org wrote that ""Rick Scott's racist voter purgewhich directly targets Latino votersis so egregious that every one of the 67 supervisors of elections in the stateDemocrats, Republicans, and independentshas so far refused to carry it out. ""Actually, many supervisors began to carry out the state directive to verify the citizenship of some voters, starting in April and continuing for several weeks. We only found one county -- Palm Beach -- that never contacted voters on the list at all.

It was at this point that many supervisors halted the purge. We also found at least two counties that did, in fact, carry out Scott's plan."

Analysis: Kucinich advocates a prompt withdrawal of U. S.  troops to be replaced with international peace keepers. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed an elaborate plan for partitioning Iraq into self-governing regions with U. S.  troops helping maintain order.

Topic: congress,diversity,religion

Analysis: Without Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is ""now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed. ""Mahers show did not respond to a request for comment. Still, Mahers unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOPs ranks. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U. S.  Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white,Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isnt leaving office until the end of his term in January. Its possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves.

"Statement: Gov. Crist's veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida.
Speaker: marco-rubio (republican party)

Analysis: That was the case before Crist vetoed the  Florida bill. Abortion foes argue the federal rules are little more  than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a  plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion."
"Statement: Says she condemned violence at a campaign stop in Arizona in March.

Analysis: And then, he, you know, when he gets on Spanish TV, he ends up saying, 'No, no. That will never get in the way' or, 'Legalization status isn't contingent on border control. "" We found, instead, that Rubio has explained the Senate bills multistep process, starting with a border security plan, in his English-language interviews with conservative hosts. He clarified that immigrants would be eligible to apply for provisional status at the same time. In Spanish, he also emphasized border security, but explained that immigrants would be eligible for provisional status  ""legalization""  before the Obama administration left office. Rubio emphasized different parts of the bills process depending on his audience  particularly what he described as happening ""first. ""But his explanations described the bills provisions the same way, in both English and in Spanish."

"Statement: Over the last few years, weve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs,labor,workers

Analysis: Obama said, ""Over the last few years, weve put more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined. ""From publicly available data, we know that since 2009, the United States has created roughly the same number of jobs as the 35 other advanced economies combined, and more than the other six biggest economies. However, its not as clear cut that this recovery involves putting ""more people back to work,"" as Obama suggests. The labor force participation rate has consistently declined during this period, suggesting that more and more unemployed Americans are dropping out of the workforce, rather than taking new jobs."

"Statement: Says U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown is responsible for over $14 trillion in debt.
Speaker: jim-demint (republican party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget

Analysis: DeMints attempt to assign a value to Browns vote sets up an accounting exercise in a vacuum, leaving out important details and context. DeMints comment also selectively ignores a Washington reality: No one politician alone can take credit for blowing the budget because the fiscal policies by both parties have shaped the government overspending since 2001. Brown has certainly voted for spending programs and to raise the debt ceiling, but DeMint left himself little wiggle room in a statement designed to score political points."

"Statement: Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas.
Speaker: jeb-bush (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,guns

Analysis: Bush said Florida has the most concealed weapon permits in the nation, ""nearly double that of the second state, which is Texas. ""On the first one, Bush is correct that Florida leads the nation in the sheer number of gun permits -- the most current figure is nearly 1. 4 million. However, eight states have a higher per-capita rate of gun permits than Florida. When he says that Florida has ""nearly double"" the number of permits as Texas he is in the ballpark -- Texas has about 826,000. So Florida has about 1. 7 times as many permit holders. Where Bush misses the mark is when he says that Texas is the second state in terms of gun permits. Current data from the Pennsylvania state patrol showed slightly more than one million permits -- so more than Texas."
"Statement: Under President George W. Bush, the U.S. had 52 months of ... uninterrupted job creation and revenues were at an all-time high in 2007.
Speaker: ed-gillespie (republican party)
Topic: economy,history,taxes

Analysis: That's high by historical standards but hardly a record. It only ties for 16th place going back to 1934, and within the 14-year stretch between 1996 and 2009 it only rises to 7th place. So if Gillespie's point is that Bush's tax cuts led to record revenues, they did -- for 2007 at least -- but that was a record aided by a the largest, non-recession economy in American history. Ultimately, Gillespie two comments are generally accurate, but they would have benefited from some additional historical context."

Speaker: martin-omalley (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,guns

Analysis: OMalley ""Secretary Clinton changes her position on (gun issues) every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards. ""In 2000, in the wake of the Columbine school shooting, Clinton was emphatic about her support for gun control. In 2008, she dropped her support for a gun license and registration proposal and positioned herself to the right of her major opponent, Obama. While Clinton also advocated for leaving some gun control to the states, she still advocated for federal gun control efforts, and she never said ""we dont need federal standards. ""In 2015, Clinton has been more forceful with her support for gun control than she was in 2008 -- closer to her rhetoric in 2000. OMalley has a point that Clintons positioning on gun control has shifted between election cycles, but it wasnt nearly as dramatic as he made it out to be."

Analysis: So did Lewis get his job creation figures right?Lewis accurately cited numbers reviewed by government agencies and experts, but in the end, that vetting wasnt enough. He used figures that would give a typical person the impression that those projected 1,399 ""job years"" are actual jobs. That understanding would be correct for the construction phase, but it would be 20 times higher than the actual number of positions needed to run the streetcar."

Analysis: Our rating Limbaugh said Wisconsin is ""one of the bluest"" states, but under Walker its unemployment rate ""is around 3. 5%. ""Although Wisconsin has voted for the Democratic nominee in the last seven presidential contests, as a frequent battleground state, it is far from being an automatic in the Democratic column. At the state level, meanwhile, Wisconsin is currently Republican red but was recently Democratic blue, and by other measures it is somewhere between the two.

Analysis: Calling for reform to Virginias gun laws, House Democrats noted that firearms -- including assault rifles -- are allowed to be brought in the state Capitol while helium balloons, flags on poles, trumpets and bullhorns are banned. The list of barred articles holds up. The firearms issue is a bit trickier. They can be brought into the Capitol, but only by lawmakers, valid concealed weapons permit holders and law enforcement. They are banned in the Senate gallery."
"Statement: Teachers are working their third consecutive year -- some longer than that -- without salary increases.

Analysis: Statistics are incomplete for this year, but indicate teacher pay was flat in most localities and even cut by six school systems. It would be accurate to say most teachers are going without a pay raise for the second straight school year. But Boitnott added a third year and the possibility of ""longer.

"Statement: Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit.
Speaker: will-weatherford (republican party)
Topic: debt,deficit,federal-budget,health-care,medicaid

Analysis: Weatherford defended his key role in blocking federal money to help insure more low-income Floridians by pointing to the effect of all that extra health care spending on the countrys national deficit and debt. ""Expanding Medicaid would require borrowing more money, drastically expanding our deficit,"" Weatherford said. Theres no doubting the federal Medicaid expansion is a lot of dough, with the government slating about $900 billion over 10 years for each state to expand the program, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Ramping up federal spending for Medicaid, one of the biggest long-term deficit-drivers, will not be cheap. Weatherfords commentary, however, is vague. He ignores nonpartisan research showing the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage is offset by other parts of the health care law. And yes, states that decide not to expand Medicaid can prevent more federal spending, but it would just further reduce the deficit -- by how much is unknown -- on top of its already slated contraction. Saying Medicaid expansion will ""drastically"" enhance the deficit is unproven."
"Statement: After (Jeb) Bushs two terms in office, Floridas graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom.
Speaker: dan-gelber (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Gelber said that ""after Bushs two terms in office, Floridas graduation rate was dead last and remains near the bottom. ""Gelber cited Morgan Quitno data which showed Florida was 50th in 2004-06. But other data sources --the federal governments method and Education Week -- showed that Florida was near the bottom of the pack in Bushs last full year but not dead last. Gelber is on more solid ground when he said that Florida ""remains near the bottom. ""In 2012-13, only seven states had a lower rate, while two were tied with Florida, according to the federal cohort method."
"Statement: Farming is one of the fastest growing areas of our economy.

"Statement: If we had been on Obamacare and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment.
Speaker: herman-cain (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: We don't know the personal details of Cain's health status or how he is insured. But it's impossible for us to see how a government bureaucrat could have delayed Cain's care. Cain said at the debate that, ""If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. ""But there is no part of the health care law that allows a government bureaucrat to weigh in on an individual's course of treatment -- not Cain's nor anyone else's."
"Statement: The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.
Speaker: rob-cornilles (republican party)
Topic: bipartisanship,climate-change,environment

Analysis: Rep.  Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department  to reject the route. Schrader is opposed to the expedited process, but not necessarily against  or for  the project. We dont think the support of one Democrat or one Republican makes a proposal bipartisan,  but its clear some Democrats are on board with the project."
"Statement: On support for gay marriage.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: gays-and-lesbians

Analysis: In a Sept.  14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, ""I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage. ""We have found nothing to contradict this view. While Romney in 1994 offered relatively liberal views on some policies of importance to gay voters, he never went so far as to support same-sex marriage. In fact, he spoke out against the idea -- and took actions to stem it while governor. Romney has been consistent on this."
"Statement: Says Mitt Romney just gave a speech a few weeks ago and said we should still have troops in Iraq.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: debates,iraq,military

Analysis: According to Obama, Romney said in a recent speech ""we should still have troops in Iraq. ""In a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the United States has been ""undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence"" and that Obama ""failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown. ""So Romney wanted a sizeable presence of U. S.  troops in Iraq past 2011 as part of a status of forces agreement, which the Obama administration sought but did not get with the Iraqi government. The agreement would have been part of an overall drawdown."
"Statement: Says David Dewhurst explicitly advocated a guest worker program for all illegal immigrants.
Speaker: ted-cruz (republican party)
Topic: immigration,workers

Analysis: Dewhursts 2007 speech advocates a guest-worker program for ""those here today illegally,"" a view he seems to have aired again in an interview a couple months later and one that he also has not forsworn, far as we can tell. So, it can fairly be said Dewhurst advocated a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants already here. Would every single illegal immigrant be in the program, as Cruz says?As a practical matter, probably not, but Dewhursts speech laid out no limits. His speech did, however, cite the need for border security, and of late, Dewhurst has said secure borders should be ensured before a guest-worker program is implemented."
"Statement: A Republican proposal changes Medicare for those under age 55 so that they will participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do.
Speaker: mike-pence (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,federal-budget,health-care,medicare,abc-news-week

Analysis: We should emphasize that Ryans Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, and there are many unanswered questions about it. But what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the kind of employer-provided health insurance that members of Congress receive. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and will likely not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they will not the same protection against rising costs that ""Fair Share"" provides members of Congress."
"Statement: Says the Affordable Care Act was a federal takeover of the student loan industry and profits on the loans go to help pay for the health care law.
Speaker: kelly-ayotte (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,education,federal-budget,health-care

Analysis: The governments Reconciliation Act of 2010 was not a takeover, but rather an elimination of a federal student loan program the government had used since 1965. Private companies are still involved in servicing the program and private lenders can still make their own student loans without a government subsidy. The government does borrow in the 2. 8 percent ballpark and loans money to students at 6. 8 percent but the difference is not a profit, it helps compensate for the unanticipated losses inherent with any loan. Finally, the money saved in the Reconciliation Act of 2010, not ""profits"" from the direct loans, is used to fund elements of the Affordable Care Act. UPDATE: This item has been updated to note that Justine Sessions is a spokeswoman for the Democrat-controlled Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor."

Analysis: Speaking about the Peterson case, Trump said that much more than 50 percent of parents are spankers. In this fact-check, were not judging whether spanking is akin to what Peterson did, were simply verifying Trumps statistic. We found two polls that put the fraction a bit over half, rather than ""much more. ""But that aside, Trump is largely correct within a broad definition of spanking."
"Statement: Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation.
Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: The campaign also cherry-picks a study by a conservative group that finds business taxes are high, but it does not account for other data that show Wisconsins business taxes are middle or low. Overall, we found the state ranked 13th for total tax burden in rankings released this year and 14th in last years. There is some room for argument over what ""one of the highest"" means. But when you look at all state and local taxes combined, we think its a stretch to put Wisconsins current ranking up on that pedestal."

Instead, we're told that after his old company merged with Baker Hughes, Flores' duties were limited to a single small project before his departure less than six months later. We don't see significance in the Flores' resume snippet touted by Edwards."

And according to the latest updates of budgeted spending, spending from all sources increased 86 percent over the years analyzed by the group, 21 percent once population growth and inflation are counted. Budgeted spending the governormost affected, of state general revenue, went up 44 percent, though that decreased 6 percent once inflation and population growth are weighed."

Analysis: Hegar tweeted: ""Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission! ""The first part of Hegars statement is obvious: Texas owns its 22. 5 million acres of public land, with the federal government owning less than 2 percent of Texas acreage, much of it in the Big Bend National Park. It also stands to reason the federal government wouldnt open a park in the state without interacting with state officials, perhaps seeking a land deal."

Speaker: scott-walker (republican party)

"Statement: Says if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams.
Speaker: jon-runyan (republican party)
Topic: health-care,medicare

Analysis: Runyan said, ""if we do nothing and continue to let Obamacare siphon off that $700 billion dollars off the top of it, Medicare goes away in less than 10 years -- certain accounts of it -- and it just falls apart at the seams. The health care law decreases growth in future Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years. It does not cut that amount from the current Medicare budget. Analysts project one of the trust funds that pay for Medicare services will be unable to meet all of its obligations in 2024, but the fund would still cover some benefits. Without the Affordable Care Act, the fund would be exhausted in 2016."
"Statement: Says Sen. John McCain spent the July 4 weekend in Islamabad, Pakistan, selling F-16s and advanced weapons to the folks who harbored Osama bin Laden.
Speaker: kelli-ward (republican party)
Topic: terrorism

Analysis: The ad distorts McCains mission in Pakistan to stir up questions about his patriotism. While McCain has discussed F-16 fighter jets with Pakistani officials, the meeting over the holiday weekend was part of a larger effort to fight terrorism. Further, the ad oversimplifies Pakistan's complicated relationship with the United States. There is plenty of legitimateconcern about the country's approach to terrorist groups, but there is no definitive proof that Pakistan (particularly the ones who met with McCain) harbored bin Laden."

"Statement: Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending.
Speaker: eric-cantor (republican party)
Topic: federal-budget

Analysis: Cantor said flights were being delayed unnecessarily because the FAA could have cut other funds before furloughing air traffic controllers. But the law authorizing sequestration states that cuts must be applied equally. Given that the FAA is a huge federal agency tasked with cutting $600 million, to say there is no wiggle room is a stretch. But sequestration does not allow elimination of entire programs or departments to spend the money on in other areas, such as paying air traffic controllers. Whats more, the fact that Congress was compelled to act to give the FAA that flexibility undercuts the argument that the agency could have moved funds around all along."
"Statement: John Cornyn has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks and fund Obamacare.
Speaker: senate-conservatives-fund (republican party)
Topic: corrections-and-updates,debt,financial-regulation,health-care,taxes

Analysis: The PAC said Cornyn ""has voted to increase the debt, raise taxes, bail out Wall Street banks, and fund Obamacare. ""Cornyn voted for the 2008 bailout and has occasionally voted to raise the debt ceiling. Also, Cornyns 2013 vote for the taxpayer-relief act raised taxes for most households though, signficantly, it also preserved lower income-tax rates than ones that would have hit if the measure didnt make it into law. Finally, the idea that Cornyn voted to fund Obamacare by agreeing to general appropriations is a political turnip; how those votes are interpreted probably depends on ones political prism. Beyond that, the government evidently can tap the funding it needs to implement the law regardless of congressional spending decisions. Cornyn voted against the Obamacare law when it came to be and continues to oppose it. CORRECTION, 1:13 p. m. , Dec.  12, 2013: This story has been amended to reflect Cornyns vote against raising the debt ceiling in October 2013. This change did not affect our rating."

Analysis: The Ohio Democratic Party said that in 177 days on the campaign trail, Kasichs security detail cost taxpayers $350,000. Our analysis confirmed that $350,000 is most likely a conservative estimate. At the current rate, the total could be twice that by the RNC in July. Since neither state officials nor Kasichs camp will confirm any details on the governors security, we have to rely on what we learned from the treasurers open records data."

Analysis: The plan does not define what's a small business and what's not. McCain calls this a ""fine,"" but being required to contribute to a pool is not the same as paying a penalty for some wrongdoing. So even by a generous definition, Obama does not fine ""small businesses. ""Indeed, they are not even subject to the mandate."

Both the S&P; press release and a longer report we reviewed from the July outlook change spoke highly of Florida's fiscal strategy, especially its willingness to cut spending as revenue dropped."
"Statement: African-American children are 500 percent more likely to die from asthma than white kids.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: children,diversity,health-care,public-health

Analysis: Clinton said, ""African-American children are 500 percent  500 percent  more likely to die from asthma than white kids. ""According to a 2006 study from the CDC, shes right. According to more recent data, shes slightly off, but only because she has underestimated the gap: In reality, it appears that black children are seven to eight times as likely to die of asthma as white children."
"Statement: U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.s did in over a century.
Speaker: addicting-information (democrat party)
Topic: guns

Analysis: Addicting Information said that ""U. S.  police killed more people in just one month than the U. K. s did in over a century. ""This comparison was based on an incomplete Wikipedia list."
"Statement: The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios.
Speaker: dennis-algiere (republican party)
Topic: baseball,corporations,economy,state-finances,voting-record

Analysis: Algiere and his fellow legislators from Westerly and Charlestown say the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios. While the legislature did overwhelmingly approve the $125-million loan guarantee fund, its clear from news stories at the time and afterward, and from the tape of the debate, that rank-and-file legislators did not know when they voted that $75 million was meant for 38 Studios, even if some of their leaders did. Whether they should have been more skeptical of the loan guarantee fund is another question."
"Statement: When we've got CEOs making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in a year ... then something is wrong.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: economy

Analysis:  Now in the same     Forbes    report on CEO compensation, Apple CEO Steve Jobs is listed as the highest-paid boss of America's 500 biggest companies at $646. 6-million a year. Doing the math on Jobs' income, he makes $53,883 in 10 minutes. That's $18,280 more than the average worker's annual salary. So, while it's fair to say     some    CEOs ""are making more in 10 minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year,"" Obama would be on safer ground if he qualified his statement."
"Statement: Says 11 soccer players on the U.S. Mens National Team are immigrants.
Speaker: nancy-pelosi (democrat party)
Topic: immigration,sports

Analysis: In a tweet pushing immigration reform, Pelosi posted a picture of the U. S.  Mens National Team missing 11 of its players and tweeted ""Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup!Look at what #USMNT would be without them. ""In this instance ""them"" means immigrants. But none of those 11 players are immigrants. Some arent even the children of immigrants."
"Statement: The president by executive order could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants who are newly legalized under pending legislation.
Speaker: michele-bachmann (republican party)
Topic: elections,immigration,legal-issues

Analysis: Bachmann said ""the president  by executive order"" could grant voting rights to illegal immigrants newly legalized under pending legislation. Its right there in the Constitution."
"Statement: Rob Portman won the fewest votes of all Ohio U. S. Senate victors since 2000.
Speaker: ohio-democratic-party (democrat party)
Topic: elections,campaign-advertising

Analysis: Take away those two and simply compare 2006 and 2010, or use all four elections but consider the margins of victory rather than each winners raw vote total. Using the latter measure, Portman would rank third out of four in margin of victory. Brown garnered more votes in 2006 than did Portman in 2010, but Portman won his lower-turnout election by a wider margin."
"Statement: Says U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn was handpicked by President Barack Obama
Speaker: david-perdue (republican party)
Topic: bipartisanship,elections

Analysis: But Nunns stated opposition to some of Obamas key policies supports the idea that she would not be a rubber stamp for the president. Perdue has a point about Nunns selection by top Democrats. But it needs a lot of additional information to be fully understood."
"Statement: China owns about 29 percent of (the U.S.) debt.
Speaker: allen-west (republican party)
Topic: china

Analysis: Although on TV he left outonlya couplewords, thosewords matter because they make a big difference here. He could haveexplained that he was referring to foreign holders of U. S.  debt -- but he didn't. So his statement makes it appear that China owns a much larger chunk of the federal debt than it does."
"Statement: Chris Sununu supported Obamas Common Core agenda, taking away local control of our schools.
Speaker: ted-gatsas (republican party)
Topic: education,voting-record

Analysis: Our Ruling  TedGatsas said that Chris Sununu, a fellow Republican, supported ""Obamas Common Core Agenda. ""As an Executive Councilor, Sununu voted in favor of testing contracts and education officials aligned with Common Core, which shows a degree of support, but he has never taken an up-or-down vote on the Common Core standards. And, while Obamas administration has incentivized states to adopt the standards, the federal government did not develop them, nor do the standards micro-manage how New Hampshire schools should deliver education."
"Statement: (President Barack Obama) said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan.
Speaker: chris-christie (republican party)
Topic: stimulus

Analysis: During his ""Face the Nation"" interview, Christie repeated the GOP talking point that Obama ""said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan. ""As PolitiFact has determined numerous times before, neither Obama personally nor his administration never made such a promise. Two economic advisers offered that projection, but stressed repeatedly that their estimates were subject to considerable ""uncertainty."
"Statement: Gwinnett County government has made significant cutbacks in staffing.
Speaker: charlotte-nash (republican party)
Topic: county-budget,taxes

Analysis: So where does that leave us?Gwinnett County does have 67 fewer employees and 90,000 more residents now than it did in 2008. In better times, the county likely would have added 100 to 200 new employees a year to meet the demands of a growing population. But its probably a stretch to say the cutback in employees is ""significant"" given the downsizing thats occurred across the public and private sectors."
"Statement: Says the Constitution specifically states the Congress shall write legislation for immigration policy, so Barack Obama lacks the authority to defer the deportation of young illegal immigrants.
Speaker: john-carter (republican party)
Topic: immigration,legal-issues

Analysis: Congress has the power to make immigration laws, as Carter says. Less clearcut is Carters interpretation that Obama has overstepped his authority. Most legal experts we consulted thought Obama was on solid ground."
"Statement: Crime rises in communities with casinos.
Speaker: georgia-family-council (none party)
Topic: crime,gambling

Analysis: Crime has gone down in some areas with casinos. It has increased in others."
"Statement: Americans spend 6.1 billion hours a year complying with tax law. It costs us $163 billion to comply with our tax laws annually.
Speaker: ron-wyden (democrat party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: It also agreed with the cost. The Advocates office ""estimates that the costs of complying with the individual and corporate income tax requirements for 2008 amounted to $163 billion  or a staggering 11 percent of aggregate income tax receipts. ""Thats good enough for us."
"Statement: A space shuttle the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton would be within a days drive of 60 percent of the U.S. population.
Speaker: michael-turner (republican party)
Topic: space,tourism

Analysis: A 500-mile range from the museum reaches across New Jersey, but doesnt take in New York city or New England. The congressional delegations underlying point was accurate -- a large portion of the U. S.  population would be within driving distance of a shuttle in Dayton. But by narrowing the starting point for the range from the entire state, as Smith-Daniels used, to just the museum, they also eliminated more than 40 million of people. Then again, they also were smart enough not to say how far theyd drive in a day."
"Statement: It isnt me cutting the budget. Its the Congressdecision on sequestration. So it isnt secretary of defense or the president doing this.
Speaker: chuck-hagel (republican party)
Topic: debt,federal-budget,military

Analysis: Hagel said it wasnt he or Obama that made defense cuts, it was Congress in passing the sequester. Hagel himself wasnt working in government at the time, so he has no tie to the cuts. Obama literally signed Congress defense cuts into law in both 2011 and 2013. At the same time, his budgets have proposed funding defense spending at a level above what the caps call for, showing that he doesnt fully support the very agreements he signed."
"Statement: Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: education

Analysis: Clintons campaign said, ""Arizona schools rank 45th in the nation, dead last in funding per student. ""Both states still spend thousands of dollars less than the national average in funding per student."
"Statement: Rhode Island is at the top of the country for alcohol-related fatalities.
Speaker: steve-archambault (democrat party)
Topic: crime

Analysis: In 2005 we ranked 11th, and in 2006 we were 10th. But in 2003 and 2004, we were ranked first in the nation in the percentage of fatalities related to alcohol. Archambault isn't completely correct about our ranking, unless you go back several years. Yet it's clear he did give an accurate assessment of the scope of the problem."
"Statement: Maj. Nidal Hasan, the man accused of the Fort Hood shootings, ""was an ADVISOR to the Obama Administration.""
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: military,terrorism

Analysis: Hasan attended a meeting on a subject relevant to his profession, that much is clear. But beyond that, there's nothing to back up the chain e-mail's accusation that he somehow was ""an ADVISOR"" to the Obama administration or that GWU's task force was involved in the new White House. In fact, the group's work began long before Obama took office and is in no way affiliated with the White House."
"Statement: Florida has the second-lowest (campaign) contribution limit in the entire country.
Speaker: will-weatherford (republican party)
Topic: campaign-finance

Analysis: Floridas limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though its not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states dont have an across-the-board limit."
"Statement: As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.
Speaker: democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,message-machine

Analysis: But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers."
"Statement: We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America.
Speaker: mitt-romney (republican party)
Topic: foreign-policy,terrorism

Analysis: Romney warned during the Republican presidential debate in Washington that ""We have, right now, Hezbollah, which is working throughout Latin America, in Venezuela, in Mexico, throughout Latin America, which poses a very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America. Even less publicly supported is the idea of that presence amounting to a ""very significant and imminent threat to the United States of America. ""The State Department confirms there are no known terror cells of al-Qaida or Hezbollah groups in our hemisphere. Romney was asked to recite a national security issue he worries ""nobody is asking about. ""In this case, there might be a good reason."
"Statement: Says taking millionaires off food stamps and unemployment would save $20 million.
Speaker: kay-bailey-hutchison (republican party)
Topic: deficit,federal-budget,jobs,taxes

Analysis: Hutchison said that getting millionaires off unemployment and food stamps would save the government $20 million -- though she doesnt acknowledge that millionaires are already barred from the food-stamp program; theres no new savings possible on that front."
"Statement: The last six polls, including this week's Time magazine, show that I beat John McCain by six or seven points.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: elections

Analysis: It's possible that Obama has access to private polls we haven't seen. We asked the campaign for a response but didn't hear back. So we will deduct a small amount on the Truth-O-Meter for his citing of ""the last six polls,"" but Obama's larger point is correct. Polls show he is winning against McCain, while Clinton either loses to McCain or beats him by a smaller margin."
"Statement: David Beckhams proposed soccer stadium at Miamis Port threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries.
Speaker: miami-seaport-alliance (none party)
Topic: county-government,jobs,recreation,sports

Analysis: The ad said that David Beckhams proposed soccer stadium at Miamis port ""threatens the 207,000 jobs and $27 billion economic impact tied to the cargo and cruise industries. ""The numbers come from a study which states that the jobs related to the port are all over Florida. The ad is somewhat careful in the wording about the jobs because it states the jobs are ""tied"" to cargo and cruise industries, but then it talks about jobs at PortMiami such as crane operators who could be replaced by stadium peanut sellers -- which could create the impression that these are all direct jobs at the port, and thats not the case. A soccer stadium at the port would certainly lead to some changes at the port -- and cruise operators are concerned about how that could change their operations."
"Statement: If we pass immigration reform, it will make wages go up on average $250 for the average household.
Speaker: martin-omalley (democrat party)
Topic: immigration

Analysis: The $250 in question is a calculation based on mathematical assumptions -- assumptions that some question -- that refers to a long-term result over two decades. In the near term, the same analysis projects wages would dip slightly."
"Statement: Says that when President Bill Clinton raised the top tax rates to levels now proposed by Obama, the country experienced significant job growth.
Speaker: barack-obama (democrat party)
Topic: deficit,jobs,taxes

Analysis: Perhaps, as Foster argues, the situation is different enough now -- more precarious -- that a tax hike would have a more damaging effect. That's a matter for economists to debate. When Obama says we saw job growth in the 1990s even as Clinton raised taxes, he's right. But to the extent that he's suggesting raising taxes created job growth -- as he appears to be when he says ""we should go with what works,"" he goes too far."
"Statement: Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns and got $570 million in job-development incentives
Speaker: greater-wisconsin-political-fund (none party)
Topic: campaign-finance,economy,elections

Analysis: But thats all it is. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past. Many of the donations were small, and Walkers jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. The ad makes a red-hot charge that suggests corruption, even putting a dollar figure on it, but cant deliver the goods."
"Statement: Due to actions by President Barack Obama, the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases.
Speaker: chain-email (none party)
Topic: corporations,government-regulation,jobs,military

Analysis: The email said that due to actions by Obama, ""the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases. ""There is a legitimate question about whether compensation changes made by the administration could squeeze the profits of fast-food restaurants on Navy and Marine bases to the point where they feel the need to shutter their outlets."
"Statement: Scott Walker has a plan to privatize state lands and wants to sell our deer to the highest bidder.
Speaker: tom-barrett (democrat party)
Topic: recreation

Analysis: His final report has not been made, there is nothing about privatization in any preliminary recommendations, and Kroll has stated clearly he does not support private management of state lands for hunters. Walker has said the same."
"Statement: The United States had allies lined up for air strikes in Syria and then Obama pulled the rug out.
Speaker: peter-king (republican party)
Topic: terrorism

Analysis: King said, ""we had allies lined up (to launch air strikes on Syria) then the president pulled the rug out. ""A handful of allies ""lined up"" for air strikes. We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. Hardly an overwhelming show of hands, but King did not specify how many in his remarks. Among the ""no"" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The Arab League and the United Nations also balked. Any support faded after Russia helped broker a diplomatic solution in which Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details."
"Statement: We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic.
Speaker: michele-bachmann (republican party)
Topic: history,military

Analysis: nan"
"Statement: Says hes signed a pledge not to raise taxes four times.
Speaker: roger-williams (republican party)
Topic: taxes

Analysis: Last year, Williams was among candidates geared up to run for U. S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchisons seat when she said she was considering stepping down to run for governor. Later, Williams campaign forwarded a copy of the no-climate tax pledge -- avowing opposition to any climate-change legislation that includes a net increase in government revenue -- signed by Williams on Feb.  14. So, Williams has signed at least three anti-tax pledges--two of them twice."
"Statement: Unemployment in Texas has risen over two percentage points with Rick Perry as governor.
Speaker: john-currie (democrat party)
Topic: economy,jobs

Analysis: Currie said unemployment has risen more than two percentage points during Perrys governorship. This is supported by cherry-picking the latest available Texas jobless rate, 6. 5 percent for July 2013, and comparing it to the 4. 2 percent rate in January 2001, Perrys first full month as governor. One can also note, for instance, that the 2013 monthly rates have been lower than the Perry-era high of 8. 3 percent in early 2010. Also, the Texas rate has trailed the national rate for more than six years. Finally, its not reasonable to blame (or credit) a governor for a states unemployment rate. How an economy fares is not determined by the states chief elected official."
"Statement: (U.S. Reps.) Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.
Speaker: state-democratic-party-wisconsin (democrat party)
Topic: medicare

Analysis: In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is ""charging constituents"" for access is far off the mark."
"Statement: Rick Perry thinks injecting 11- and 12-year-old girls with a controversial drug (the HPV vaccine), without a parents consent, is a good idea.
Speaker: lone-star-first (none party)
Topic: children,message-machine

Analysis: The order included an opt-out for parents who objected to the vaccine. Parents and guardians are gatekeepers for children getting the vaccinations required for students to go to Texas schools. Perry's failed mandate would not have changed that, and the ad sounds like Perry endorsed forcing families against their will to vaccinate their children with a scary drug."
"Statement: A 2005 gay pride vote had nothing to do with discrimination.
Speaker: tom-scott (none party)
Topic: gays-and-lesbians

Analysis: The policy does involve discrimination. A group of people is treated differently. They aren't treated differently because of individual merit. They're treated differently because they belong to that group."
"Statement: The Republicans still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street.
Speaker: hillary-clinton (democrat party)
Topic: social-security

Analysis: Clinton said Republicans ""still want to privatize (Social Security). In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security trust fund to Wall Street. ""At least one candidate, Cruz, has proposed a form of privatization involving personal accounts funded by a fraction of payroll taxes. Still, Clintons statement takes a longstanding Democratic exaggeration about the scope of GOP overhaul proposals and makes it even further off-base by implying that payroll tax revenues would flow directly to Wall Street without any input from beneficiaries."
"Statement: On the night of the Iowa caucuses, Obama promised the nation that he would do health care reform focused on cost containment, he opposed an individual mandate, and he said he was going to do it with Republicans.
Speaker: tim-pawlenty (republican party)
Topic: health-care

Analysis: The jury's still out on cost containment. However, we have been tracking a campaign promise of Obama's to ""cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year. ""We've rated that promise Stalled, becausepremiums are not projected to decreasein the coming years. There's a bit of uncertainty there, however, as it will be several years before the health care law is fully implemented."
"Statement: Says Florida rubber-stamped phony horse racing.
Speaker: united-florida-horsemen (none party)
Topic: gambling,market-regulation

Analysis: In an ad campaign, United Florida Horsemen contend that Florida ""rubber-stamped phony horse racing. """"Phony"" is a strong word that takes on a different meaning depending on whom you ask. Someone who just wants to watch horses take off?They may say the Gretna flag drop is cool. Someone from the traditional quarter horse industry may say NO WAY. The horsemen deployed a heaping of rhetoric in trying to get the attention of Scott and other people who just arent interested in horse racing. We get that, but we think an otherwise pretty accurate point about the division allowing a race track to offer offbeat, controversial parimutuel flag-drop racing is obscured by the hyperbole."
"Statement: One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks.
Speaker: upendra-chivukula (democrat party)
Topic: candidates-biography,guns

Analysis: Chivukula said ""one of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks. The survey Chivukulas campaign cited shows Lance, as a state legislator, favored enforcing New Jerseys current laws."
